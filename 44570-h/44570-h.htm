AFTER <em class="e000I2">the brilliant success which attended,
in the spring of last year, our volume on</em>
The Fan—<em class="e000I2">a success which was the result,
as I cannot conceal from myself, much more of the
original conception and decorative execution of that
work of luxe than of its literary interest—I have
determined to close this series of</em> Woman’s Ornaments
<em class="e000I2">by a last little work on the protective adornments of
that delicate being, as graceful as she is gracious</em>:
The Sunshade, the Glove, the Muff. <em class="e000I2">This collection,
therefore, of feminine toys will be limited to
two volumes, a collection which at first sight appeared
to us so complex and heavy that a dozen
volumes at least would have been required to contain
its principal elements. This, doubtless, on the one
hand, would have tried our own constancy, and on
the other, would have failed in fixing more surely

AFTER <em class="e000I2">the brilliant success which attended,
in the spring of last year, our volume on</em>
The Fan—<em class="e000I2">a success which was the result,
as I cannot conceal from myself, much more of the
original conception and decorative execution of that
work of luxe than of its literary interest—I have
determined to close this series of</em> Woman’s Ornaments
<em class="e000I2">by a last little work on the protective adornments of
that delicate being, as graceful as she is gracious</em>:
The Sunshade, the Glove, the Muff. <em class="e000I2">This collection,
therefore, of feminine toys will be limited to
two volumes, a collection which at first sight appeared
to us so complex and heavy that a dozen
volumes at least would have been required to contain
its principal elements. This, doubtless, on the one
hand, would have tried our own constancy, and on
the other, would have failed in fixing more surely
the inconstancy of our female readers. The spirit
has its freaks of independence, and the unforeseen of
life ought to be carefully economised. Moreover, to
tell the whole truth, the decorative elegance of a book
like the present hides very often beneath its prints
the torture of an intellectual thumbscrew. The
unhappy author is obliged to confine his exuberant
ideas in a sort of strait-jacket in order to slip them

<h2 title="The Sunshade—the Parasol—the Umbrella">
 THE SUNSHADE<br />
 <i>THE PARASOL —— THE UMBRELLA</i></h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_011b.jpg"
width="52" height="52" alt="" />THE author of a <em
class="e000I2">Dictionary of Inventions</em>, after having proved the
use of the Parasol in France about 1680, openly gives up any attempt
to determine its precise original conception, which indeed seems to
be completely concealed in the night of time.</p>

<p>It would evidently be childish to attempt to assign a date to the
invention of Parasols; it would be better to go back to Genesis at
once. A biblical expression, <em class="e000I2">the shelter which
defends from the sun</em>, would almost suffice to demonstrate the
Oriental origin of the Parasol, if it did not appear everywhere
in the most remote antiquity—as well in the Nineveh sculptures,
discovered and described by M. Layard; as on the bas-reliefs of the
palaces or frescoes of the tombs of Thebes and Memphis.</p>

<p>In China they used the Parasol more than two thousand
years before Christ. There is mention of it in the <em
class="e000I2">Thong-sou-wen</em>, under the denomination of <em
class="e000I2">San-Kaï</em>, in the time of the first dynasties,
and a Chinese legend attributes the invention of it to the wife
of Lou-pan, a celebrated carpenter of antiquity. “Sir,” said this
incomparable spouse to her husband, “you make with extreme cleverness
houses for men, but it is impossible to make them move, whilst the
object which I am framing for their private use can be carried to any
distance, beyond even a thousand leagues.”</p>

<p>And Lou-pan, stupefied by his wife’s genius,
then saw the unfolding of the first Parasol.</p>

<p>Interesting as these legends may be, handed
down by tradition to the peoples of the East,
they have no more historical credit than our delicate
fables of mythology: they preserve in themselves
less of the poetic quintessence, and above
all seem less connected with that mysterious charm
with which Greek paganism drowned that charming
Olympus wherefrom the very origins of art appear
to descend.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 496px;">
<img src="images/i_013.jpg" width="426" height="700" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Let the three Graces be represented burned
by Apollo, tired of flying through the shadows,
where Fauns and Ægipans lie in ambush, or let
these three fair ones be painted in despair at the
fiery sensation of sunburning which brands their
epidermis; let them invoke Venus, and let the
Loves appear immediately, bearers of unknown
instruments, busily occupied in working the little
hidden springs, ingeniously showing their different
uses and salutary effects; let a poet—a Voltaire,
a Dorat, a Meunier de Querlon, or an
Imbert of the time—be kind enough to forge
some rhymes of gold on this fable; let
him, in fine, inspired by these goddesses,
compose an incontestable master-piece,
and behold <em class="e000I2">the Origin of the Sunshade</em>!
graven in pretty legendary letters on the
temple of Memory, not to be contradicted
by any spectacled <em class="e000I2">savant</em> in the world.</p>

<p>But if no poet, in smart affected style,
has told us in rhyme <em class="e000I2">the Story of the Parasol</em>,
many poets of all times have
recalled the use of it in
precious verses, which appear to serve as landmarks
for history, and as references to discoveries
of archæology. In ancient Greece, in the time of
the festivals of Bacchus, it was the custom, not
then confounded with fashion, to carry a Sunshade,
not so much to extenuate the ardour of
the sun, but as a sort of religious ceremonial. Paciaudi,
in his treatise <em class="e000I2">De Umbellæ Gestatione</em>, shows
us on the carriage on which the statue of Bacchus
is placed a youth seated, the bearer of a Sunshade,
a sign of divine majesty. Pausanias, in
his <em class="e000I2">Arcadics</em>, mentions the Sunshade in describing
the festivals of Alea in Argolis, whilst later on, in
the <em class="e000I2">Eleutheria</em>, we see the Parasol also. Lastly,
after having painted for us, in a marvellous description
of Alexandria on a holiday, the hierophants,
bearers of emblems and the mystic vase,
the Monads covered with ivy, the Bassarids with
scattered hair wielding their thyrsus, Athenæus
suddenly shows us the magnificent chariot of
Bacchus, where the statue of the god, six cubits
high, all in gold, with a purple robe falling to
his heels, had over his head a Sunshade ornamented
with gold. Bacchus alone, of all the gods,
had the privilege of the Sunshade, if we rely on
the evidence of ancient monuments, earthen vases,
and graven stones drawn from the museums of
Stosch and other archæologists.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 299px;">
<img src="images/i_015.jpg" width="299" height="135" alt="" />
</div>

<p>As a result of their frequent relations with the
Greeks after the death of Alexander the Great, the
Jews appear to have borrowed from the Gentiles,
in the celebration of their Feast of Tabernacles, the
use of the Sunshade. The subjoined medal of
Agrippa the Old,
struck by the Hellenised
Jews, in some
sort supports this, although
Spanheim, in a passage relating to this
medal, says he has hesitated a long while as to the
signification of the symbols which it represents. Do
the ears of corn mark the fertility of the governed
provinces, or do they refer to the Feast of Tabernacles?
As for the tent on the obverse, it is little
probable that it represents a tabernacle according
to Moses’ rite, since the roofs of these tabernacles,
far from being pointed, were flat and cloven in the
midst, so as to allow rain, sun, and starlight to pass
through. It must then be the Sunshade, the emblem
of royalty; this at least seems probable.</p>

<p>The Parasol played among the Greeks a very important
part, as well in the sacred and funeral ceremonies
as in the great holidays of nature, and even
in the private life of the noble ladies of Athens.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 486px;">
<img src="images/i_016.jpg" width="426" height="700" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The Parasol in its elegant form may be seen
drawn on the majority of Greek vases, either
painted with straight or arched branches, concave
or convex, or in the shape of a hemisphere
or a tortoise’s back. But the
Sunshade with movable rods, opening
or shutting, existed at that time, as is
sufficiently indicated by the phrase of
Aristophanes in the <em class="e000I2">Knights</em> (Act v.
Scene 2)—“His ears opened and shut
something like a sunshade.”</p>

 <div id="i017b2">&#160;</div>
 <div id="i017b3">&#160;</div>

<p>An archæologist might amuse himself
with writing a special work on the
rôle of the Sunshade in Greece; documents
would not fail him; nay, the
book would soon grow big, and might
bristle with notes from all quarters,
abounding in the margins, after the
example of those good solid volumes
of the sixteenth century, which
none but a hermit would have the leisure
to read conscientiously to-day. Such is not
our business in this light chapter.</p>

<p>One cannot exactly say for what motive
the Sunshade was carried by young virgins
in all the processions in the Thesmophoria,
the festivals of Eleusis, and the Panathenæa.
Aristophanes calls the baskets and the
white Sunshades “symbolic instruments,
destined to recall to human beings the acts
of Ceres and Proserpine.”</p>

<p>Perhaps it is not necessary to search beyond this Aristophanic
definition, which may on the whole entirely satisfy us. Moreover,
these Sunshades were white, not, say they, because the statue erected
by Theseus to Minerva was of that colour, but because white marked
the liveliest joy and pomp according to Ovid, who recommends very
carefully in his <em class="e000I2">Fasti</em> the wearing in sign
of rejoicings white tunics worthy of pleasing Ceres, in whose cult
both the priestesses and the things they used ought to be entirely
white.</p>

<p>In a man, according to Anacreon, the carrying a Parasol was the
mark of a libertine and effeminate life; one might draw an analogous
conclusion from a scene in the <em class="e000I2">Birds</em> of
Aristophanes, in which Prometheus, through fear of Jupiter, cries to
his slave, before abandoning himself to a sweet passion for Venus
only, “Quick, take this sunshade, and hold it over me, in order that
the gods may not see me.”</p>

<p>It is also doubtless for the same reason, which
virtually interdicted the use of the Parasol to men,
that the daughters of the Metœci, or strangers
domiciled at Athens, carried, according to Ælian,
the sunshade of the Athenian women in the spectacles
and public ceremonies, whilst the fathers
carried the vases destined for the sacrifices.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:200px;">
<img src="images/i_018.jpg" width="200" height="200" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The <em class="e000I2">Θολἱα</em>, or “Sunshade Hat,”
succeeded the Parasol properly so called. It is of these <em
class="e000I2">Θολἱα</em> that Theocritus speaks in several places;
it is also this hat, and not a Sunshade, which we must see in the
curious medal above, stamped by the Ætolians, which represents Apollo
bearing this strange hat, in the style of Yokohama, hanging on his
back.</p>

<p>From the most distant epochs the Sunshade has been considered,
so far as it is the attribute of gods and sovereigns, as the ensign
of omnipotence. We see it playing this supreme rôle, not only by
right of an emblem of blazonry, in the curious dissertation of the
Chevalier Beatianus <em class="e000I2">On a Sunshade of vermeil
on a field argent, symbol of power, sovereign authority and true
friendship</em>, but also we see it universally adopted as a sign of
the highest distinction by Oriental peoples, to be displayed over
the head of the king in time of peace, and occasionally in time of
war.</p>

<p>It is thus that it may be contemplated on the sculptures of
ancient Egypt, where its usage was not exclusively indeed reserved
to the Pharaohs, but sometimes also to the great dignitaries,
but to these only. There is to be seen in Wilkinson a strange
engraving representing an Æthiopian princess seated on a <em
class="e000I2">plaustrum</em> or carriage drawn by oxen, and
having behind her a vague personage armed with a large Parasol
of an undecided form, something between the screen and the <em
class="e000I2">flabellum</em> in the segment of a circle. Is it not
also in sign of adoration that it was the custom to put above the
heads of divine statues crescents, Sunshades, little spheres, which
served not only to guarantee these august heads against the injuries
of time and the ordures of birds, but also to set their physiognomy
in relief as by a nimbus or crown of paganism?</p>

<p>The kings or satraps of Persia of the oldest dynasties
were sheltered by the sovereign Parasol. Chardin, in his <em
class="e000I2">Voyages</em>, describes bas-reliefs of a time long
before that of Alexander the Great, in which the king of Persia is
frequently represented sometimes just about to mount his horse, at
others surrounded by young slave-girls—beautiful as day, as a poet
might write for sake of a simile—among whom one inclines a Sunshade,
while another uses a flyflap made of a horse’s silky tail. Other
bas-reliefs, again, represent the Persian monarch on a throne, at
the conclusion of a victorious battle, whilst the rebels are being
crucified, and writhe under the punishment, and prisoners brought up,
one after the other, make humble submission. Here the Sunshade has
the floating appearance of a glorious standard. It symbolised also
the power of life and death, vested in the savage conqueror over the
unfortunate conquered, delivered up wholly to his mercy.</p>

<p>In ancient India, the cradle of the human race, as it is
said, the Parasol in every time, and more than anywhere
else, is unfolded in its splendour and the grace of its contexture,
as an immutable symbol of royal majesty. It
seems really that it was under the deep azure of the admirable
Indian sky that the coquettish instrument, of which
we are exposing here by literary zigzags the historic summary,
was invented. It must have been born there first as
a fragile buckler to oppose the ardour of the sun; afterwards,
doubtless, it developed, little by little, into a large
dome, carried in the arms of slaves, or on the back of an
elephant, showing the sparkle of its colours, the originality
of its form, the richness of its tissues, all overloaded with
fine gold and silver filigree, making its spangles and jewels
scintillate in the full leaping light, in the slow oscillation
given to it by the march of its bearers, or the swayings of a
heavy pachyderm, in the midst of magic powers, of dancers
and enchantments without number among the
most bizarre palaces of the world.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<p>In Hindostan the large Parasol is commonly called <em
class="e000I2">Tch’hâtâ</em>, the small ordinary Parasol <em
class="e000I2">Tch’hâtry</em>, and the bearer of the Parasol for
dignitaries <em class="e000I2">tch’hâtâ-wâlâ</em>.</p>

<p>The Parasol <em class="e000I2">of seven stages</em> (<em
class="e000I2">savetraxat</em>) is the first ensign of royalty: it
is found graven on the royal seal. The mythology and literature of
the Hindoos are, so to speak, confusedly peopled with Parasols. In
his fifth incarnation, Vishnu descends to Hades with a Parasol in his
hand. On the other hand, from the seventh century, Hiouen Thsang has
remarked, according to the rites of the kingdom of Kapitha, Brâhma
and Indra were represented holding in their hand, one a flyflap, the
other a Parasol. In the <em class="e000I2">Râmayana</em> (ch. xxvi.
<em class="e000I2">scloka</em> 12), Sitâ, speaking of Râma, whose
beautiful eyes resemble the petals of the lotus, expresses herself
thus—“Covered with the Parasol striped with a hundred rays, and such
as the entire orb of the moon, why do I not see thy most charming
face shining beneath it?”</p>

<p>We read also in the <em class="e000I2">Mahâbârata</em> (<em
class="e000I2">sclokas</em> 4941-4943)—“The litter on which was
placed the inanimate body of the monarch Pândou was adorned with a
flyflap, a fan, and a white <em class="e000I2">Sunshade</em>; at the
sound of all the instruments of music, men by hundreds offered, in
honour of the extinguished shoot of Kourou, a crowd of flyflaps, <em
class="e000I2">white Sunshades</em>, and splendid robes.”</p>

<p>The Mahratta princes who reigned in Punah
and Sattara held the title of <em class="e000I2">Tch’hâtâ pati</em>, “Lord
of the Parasol;” and we are told that one of the
most esteemed titles of the monarch of Ava was
also that of “King of the White Elephant, and
Lord of the Four-and-twenty Parasols.”</p>

<p>When, in 1877, the Prince of Wales, future inheritor
of the throne of England, undertook his
famous voyage into India, it was absolutely necessary—says
Dr. W. H. Russell, the scrupulous historian
of that princely expedition—in order to make
him known to the natives, to set the Prince upon an
elephant, and to hold over his head the golden Sunshade,
symbol of his sovereignty.</p>

<p>There may be seen to-day in the South Kensington
Museum, in the admirable Indian gallery which
has just been installed, some score of the Parasols
brought back by the Prince from his voyage, of
which each particular type deserves a description
which cannot, alas! to our sincere regret, find its
place here. One may admire there the state Umbrella
of Indore, in the form of a mushroom; the
Sunshade of the Queen of Lucknow, in blue satin
stitched with gold and covered with fine pearls;
next the Parasols of gilt paper, others woven of different
materials, some entirely covered with ravishing
feathers of rare birds, all with long handles in gold
or silver, damascened, in painted wood, in carved
ivory, of a richness and an
execution not to be forgotten.</p>

<p>Let us tear ourselves away, as in duty bound, from Hindustan,
to meet again with the Parasol on more classic ground in ancient
Rome, in the middle of the Forum and of the games of the Circus. The
Sunshade is found very frequently in the most ancient paintings, on
stones and vases of Etruria, a long while even before the Roman era.
According to Pliny and Valerius Maximus, it is from Campania that
the Velarium comes, which is destined to defend the spectators from
the sun. The use of <em class="e000I2">the private Sunshade for each
person</em> established itself by degrees on those days when, on
account of the wind, the Velarium could not be used. Martial says in
his <em class="e000I2">Epigrams</em> (Book IV.):</p>

of Indore, in the form of a mushroom; the
Sunshade of the Queen of Lucknow, in blue satin
stitched with gold and covered with fine pearls;
next the Parasols of gilt paper, others woven of different
materials, some entirely covered with ravishing
feathers of rare birds, all with long handles in gold
or silver, damascened, in painted wood, in carved
ivory, of a richness and an
execution not to be forgotten.</p>

<p>Let us tear ourselves away, as in duty bound, from Hindustan,
to meet again with the Parasol on more classic ground in ancient
Rome, in the middle of the Forum and of the games of the Circus. The
Sunshade is found very frequently in the most ancient paintings, on
stones and vases of Etruria, a long while even before the Roman era.
According to Pliny and Valerius Maximus, it is from Campania that
the Velarium comes, which is destined to defend the spectators from
the sun. The use of <em class="e000I2">the private Sunshade for each
person</em> established itself by degrees on those days when, on
account of the wind, the Velarium could not be used. Martial says in
his <em class="e000I2">Epigrams</em> (Book IV.):</p>
</div>
<!--**********-->

<div class="poembox">
<p class="pi0"><em class="e000I2">Accipe quæ nimios vincant umbracula
 soles</em></p>
<p class="pi1"><em class="e000I2">Sit licet et ventus, te tua vela
 tegent.</em></p></div>

<p>People used the Sunshade not only at theatres,
but also at battles, and above all in the promenade.
Ovid, in his <em class="e000I2">Fasti</em>, shows us Hercules
protecting his well-beloved Omphale by means
of a Sunshade from the sun’s rays:</p>

<div class="poembox">
<p class="pi0"><em class="e000I2">Aurea pellebant tepidos umbracula
soles</em></p>
<p class="pi1"><em class="e000I2">Quæ tamen Herculeæ sustinuere
manus.</em></p>
</div>

<p>This image of Hercules carrying a light Parasol would surely
be worthy to replace the used-up theme of the distaff?</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_025.jpg" width="600" height="560" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The ancient Romans brought to the decoration
of their Parasols a magnificence unknown in our
days. They borrowed from the East its stuffs, its
jewels, its ornamental style, to enrich in the best
manner possible these pretty portable tents. When
Heliogabalus, forgetting his sex, after the example of
the priests of Atys, appeared on his car clothed with
the long dress and all the gewgaws that women wear;
when he caused himself to be drawn along surrounded
by legions of nude slave-girls, he carried a fan in the
guise of a sceptre; and not only was there a golden Parasol
in the form of a dais stretched over his head, but also at
each side two <em class="e000I2">umbelliferæ</em> held light Sunshades of silk,
covered with diamonds, mounted on Indian bamboo, or
on a stem of gold carved and encrusted with the most
wondrous jewels.</p>

<p>In the train which accompanied a matron on the Appian
Way, if we can believe the historian of <em class="e000I2">Rome in the age of
Augustus</em>, two slaves were obligatory: the fan-bearer (<em class="e000I2">flabellifera</em>)
and the follower (<em class="e000I2">pedis sequa</em>). The latter carried
an elegant Parasol of linen stretched over light rods at the
extremity of a very long reed, so that, at the least sign of
her mistress, she might direct over her the shadow of this
movable defence.</p>

<p>The Roman Umbrella seems to have been nothing
but a simple morsel of leather, according to
these verses, which Martial wrote by way of advice:</p>

<div class="poembox">
<p class="pi0"><em class="e000I2">Ingrediare viam cœlo licet usque
 sereno;</em></p>
<p class="pi1"><em class="e000I2">Ad subitas nunquam scortea desit
 aquas.</em></p>
</div>

<p>This “leather cloth” was assuredly an Umbrella,
which, except perhaps in weight, need have envied
nothing of our own.</p>

<p>At Rome, as at Athens, the Sunshade appears to
have hidden people from the looks of the gods, for,
according to Montfauçon, even the Triclinia were
covered with a sort of Sunshade, that folk might
deliver themselves more mysteriously to orgies of
every kind and to the pleasures of Venus.</p>

<p>The material used in the manufacture of Sunshades
was originally, according to Pliny, leaves of
palm divided into two, or the tresses of the osier;
afterwards they were made in silk, in purple, in
Eastern stuffs, in gold, in silver; they were adorned
with Indian ivory; they were starred with trinkets
and jewels. One author tells us even of Sunshades
made out of women’s hair—<em class="e000I2">the hair of women so
arranged as to supply the place of a Sunshade</em>.</p>

<p>Singular headdress or singular Parasol!</p>

<p>Juvenal speaks of a green Sunshade sent with
some yellow amber to a friend to celebrate her
birthday and the return of spring.</p>

<div class="poembox">
<p class="pi0"><em class="e000I2">En cui tu viridem umbellam, cui succina mittas</em></p>
<p class="pi0"><em class="e000I2">Grandia, natalis quoties redit, aut madidum ver</em>
 <em class="e000I2">Incipit.</em></p></div>

<p>And with regard to this <em class="e000I2">green</em> Sunshade, apropos
of the <em class="e000I2">viridem</em>, all the commentators enter into the
field, and make a deafening noise to explain that
the epithet had no reference to the colour of the
Sunshade, but to the spring.</p>

<p>Let us, if you please, leave Rome, without entering
into these idle dissertations.</p>

<p>It would be difficult for us to find in the Middle
Ages numerous manifestations of the Sunshade in
private life; it was evidently adopted in the ceremonies
of the Christian Church and in the royal
<em class="e000I2">entrées</em>; but it was especially the privilege of the
great, and never appeared save on solemn days in
the processions, as later on the dais, reserved for
kings and ecclesiastical nobles.</p>

<p>At Venice the Doge had already his celebrated
Sunshade in 1176. The Pope Alexander III. had
accorded to the Venetian chiefs the right to carry
the Sunshade in the processions. Under the reign
of the Doge Giovanni Dandolo (1288) it was ordered
that the pretty golden statuette of the Annunciation
should be added, which is seen represented at the
top of the Sunshade of the Venetian dogate.</p>

<p>One can get some idea of this marvellous Sunshade,
all of gold brocade, and of a pompous and
original shape, by looking at most of the prints
of the time, and particularly at the celebrated
engraving of the <em class="e000I2">Procession of the Doge</em>, as well
as at the pictures of Canaletto, Francesco Guardi,
Tiepolo, and the greater number of the charming
Venetian painters of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>It seems evident that the Roman Gauls
knew the use of the Parasol, but it would
not be easy to demonstrate its existence
logically in the martial and Gothic epochs.
One can scarcely imagine these men of
arms, these gentle pages, and these noble
damsels, with their lofty head-gear and
long dress, defended by a frail silken <em class="e000I2">encas</em>
(in case). They feared not then assuredly
either sun or rain; they dreamed
of nought but <em class="e000I2">batailloles</em> (little battles),
according to the language of that day;
everything was done in honour of the
ladies, after the laws of the good King
René, and the ladies would certainly never
have wished at the hour of the glorious
tournaments to shelter themselves at the
approaches of the lists, against a sun
which sparkled on the breastplate of
their brave knights with as much
brightness as the hope which
shone in their eyes.</p>

<p>Let us come now to China, to find
there Parasols and Umbrellas in
great honour, since the beginning of
the dynasty <em class="e000I2">Tchéou</em> (eleventh century
before Christ).</p>

<p>“The Umbrellas of that time,”
says M. Natalis Rondot, “resembled
ours; the mounting was composed of twenty-eight
curved branches, and covered with silken stuff.
The Parasols were of feathers.</p>

<p>“After the <em class="e000I2">Thong-ya</em>, it is only under
the first Wei (<em class="e00S02">A.D.</em> 220-264) that gentlemen
began the use of Parasols; these Parasols were most frequently made
of little rods of bamboo and oiled paper; pedestrians never made use
of them before the second Wei (386-554). Parasols figure ordinarily
in processions and funerals since the seventh century. Thus, in
648, at the time of the inauguration of the Convent of the Grand
Beneficence, at Si-ngan-Fou, one counted—says the historian of the
<em class="e000I2">Life of Hiouen thsang</em>—only in the procession
three hundred Parasols of precious stuffs. The Parasol in China, as
in India, has always been a sign of elevated rank, although it has
not been exclusively used by emperors and mandarins. Formerly, it
seems, four-and-twenty Parasols were carried before the Emperor when
his Majesty went to the chase.</p>

<p>“A Chinese of a rank at all elevated, such
as a mandarin, a bonze, or a priest, never goes out
without a Parasol,” according to M. Marie Cazal,
a Sunshade manufacturer, who, about the year
1844, wrote a small <em class="e000I2">Essay on the Umbrella, the
Walking-stick, and their Manufacture</em>.—‘Every
Chinese of a superior order is followed by his
slave, who carries his Parasol extended over him.’</p>

<p>“The Umbrella in China is destined to the
same use as the Parasol, says M. Cazal: it belongs
to all. Never, when the weather is the least degree
doubtful, does a Chinese go out of doors without
his Umbrella. Even horses are sheltered, as well
as elephants, by Parasols or Umbrellas fastened
to branches of bamboo. Their drivers take very
good care not to illtreat them; imbued as they
are, like every good Chinaman, with the doctrines
of metempsychosis, they fear to torture the soul of
their father or their grandfather, reduced, in order
to expiate his faults, to animate the body of these
quadrupeds.”</p>

<p>The Umbrellas and Parasols which are most common
in China resemble very much those which
are imported into Europe; they are made entirely
of stalks of bamboo, disposed with enormous art,
and covered with oiled, tarred, or lacquered paper.
Some are coloured, and have printed on them religious
allegories or sentences of Confucius.</p>

<p>All the voyages in China and around the world
are filled with details of the Chinese Parasol.
“The Chinese women, whose feet have been
compressed from infancy,” remarks M. Charles
Lavollée, “can scarcely walk, and are obliged
to support themselves on the handle of their
Parasol, which serves them for a walking-stick.”</p>

<p>The Parasol and the Fan in China play a rôle
so considerable, that it would be necessary to write
a special monograph on each of these two objects
in order to consider properly their importance in
the history of the country and its current manners.
In a general and summary sketch like the present,
must we not skim through, rather than sew together
documents collected with difficulty, or
found within reach, and leave aside the more
bulky bundles, under pain of foundering in the
folio form of heavy dictionaries?</p>

 <p>Everywhere on the exquisite decorative combinations of Japan,
we see a large Parasol opened amidst delicate peach-blossoms,
gracious flights of strange birds, indented leaves, and rosy
ibises. Sometimes, on the inimitable paintings of the enamelled
vases, the Japanese Sunshade shelters a king’s daughter, escorted
by her followers, who makes her chaste preparations for entering
the bath; sometimes, on a thin gauze, the Parasol half hides women,
promenading on the margin of some vast blue lake, full of ideal
dreams. Sometimes, in fine, in a fantastic sketch of an album, which
one reads as a riot of the imagination, is perceived some human
being excited to a singular degree, with hair tossed by the wind,
and haggard eye, floating at the will of the tumultuous waves on a
Parasol turned upside down, to the handle of which he clings with
the energy of despair. The plates of the <em class="e000I2">Voyage
de Ricord</em>, and especially the old Japanese albums, are useful
to consult in order to understand better the varieties of forms
of the Sunshade in Japan. We gain a bizarre notion of the effects
and services which a Japanese can obtain from a common Parasol
of his country by looking at the games of the acrobats who come
to us occasionally from Tokio, Yedo, or Yokohama. Théophile
Gautier, who was highly astonished, and not without reason, at the
quickness, grace, and daring of these marvellous equilibrists,
has left us on this matter the fairest pages, perhaps, of his <em
class="e000I2">Feuilletons de Lundiste</em>. The worthy Théo, that
Gallic Rajah borrowed from these clowns, astonishing in their
lightness, an enthusiasm which put on his palette as a colourist
the most vibrating tones and the finest shades. The Sunshade and
the Fan are in fact presented by these magicians of the East with
particular graces in the jugglery of the most varied exercises. Here
it is a ball of ivory which rolls with the bickering of a babbling
stream over the lamels or ribs of the Sunshade; there it is a Parasol
held in equilibrium on the blade of a dagger, and a thousand other
astonishing inventions. All these fascinating feats of skill cannot
be described save in the manner of Gautier, in other words, by
veritable pen-pictures. Admirable interpretation of things glimpsed
at!</p>

<p>In the tea-houses of Tokio, the pretty <em class="e000I2">Geishas</em>
often employ, to mimic an expressive dance, the
Fan and the little paper Parasol.</p>

<p>One of the most usual of their dances, managed
something like our ballets, is called the Rain-dance.
This is the way in which a <em class="e000I2">Globe-trotter</em> gives an
account of its leading idea and character:—</p>

<p>“Some young girls prepare to leave their homes,
and to pose as beauties in the streets of Yedo.
They admire each other in playing their fans, they
are dressed in superb toilets—they are sure of turning
the heads of all the young <em class="e000I2">samouraï</em> of the
town.</p>

<p>“Scarcely have they got out of doors when a
thick cloud appears. Great disquietude! They
open their Parasol, and make a thousand pretty
grimaces, to show how sadly they fear the ruin of
their charming dresses. . . . A few drops of rain
begin to fall: they quicken their steps on their way
home again.</p>

<p>“A burst of thunder occasioned by the <em class="e000I2">Samisen</em>
and the drums, is heard, which announces a terrible
downpour. Then our four dancers catch their
robes with both hands, and throw them with one
sweep under their arms, and suddenly turning, take
to their heels, showing us a row of little . . . .
frightened faces, saving themselves at the full
speed of their legs.”</p>

<p>What a series of pantomimes, in which the Sunshade
must assume in the hands of the charming
<em class="e000I2">Geishas</em> the most seductive positions!</p>

published a small notice on <em class="e000I2">Umbrellas, Parasols,
and Walking-sticks</em> in London about 1871). There is the same
importance attached to it among certain blacks of Western Africa,
who have probably borrowed it from the Arabs. Niebuhr, in the
description of the procession of the Imam of Sanah, tells us that
the Imam, and every one of the princes of his numerous family, had
carried by their side a <em class="e000I2">Madalla</em> or large
Parasol. It is in that country a privilege of princes of the blood.
The same writer relates that many independent chiefs of Yemen bear
<em class="e000I2">Madallas</em> as a mark of their independence.
In Morocco the Emperor alone and his family have the privilege of
the Parasol. In the <em class="e000I2">Voyages of Aly Bey</em> we
read in fact:—“The retinue of the Sultan was composed of a troop of
from fifteen to twenty gentlemen as the vanguard; behind them, some
hundred paces, came the Sultan, mounted on a mule, having beside him,
also mounted on a mule, an officer carrying the Imperial Parasol. The
Parasol is the distinctive sign of the sovereign of Morocco. No one
but he would dare to use it.”</p>

<p>In certain tribes of central Africa explorers
speak of having encountered,
amidst the tribes of the desert, kings
half-dressed in European old clothes,
taken or exchanged no one knows
where; and, strangely enough, on the

and handled with such ceremonies that a strong lackey must have had
considerable difficulty in holding it up. From this to place light
Sunshades of silk between the dainty fingers of “fair and gentle
dames” of that time, especially for a hunt through the woods, there
is, it seems to us, a departure which good sense alone, not to
mention historic science, is quite enough to point out.</p>
</div>
<!--**********-->

<p>The Parasol was still very little known in France, even in the
second half of the sixteenth century. It is fairly certain that,
like the <em class="e000I2">Fan</em>, and other objects so much in
favour with Catherine de Medici, it was brought into France out
of Italy. Henri Estienne, in his <em class="e000I2">Dialogues
of the new French Language Italianised</em>, 1578, makes one
of his interlocutors called Celtophile say: “ . . . . and <em
class="e000I2">à propos</em> of pavilion, have you ever seen what
some of the lords in Spain or Italy carry or cause to be carried
about in the country, to defend themselves, not so much from the
flies, as from the sun? It is supported by a stick, and so made
that being folded up and occupying very little space, it can when
necessary be opened immediately and stretched out in a circle so as
to cover three or four persons.” And Philausone answers: “I have
never seen one; but I have heard talk of them often; and if our
ladies were to see them carrying these things, they would perhaps tax
them with too great delicacy.”</p>

<p>In Italy it is little probable that since the Romans
the inhabitants of the higher classes have ever
unlearned the pleasant use of Parasols. The majority
of travellers notice them in all epochs, and in
the <em class="e000I2">Italian Mysteries</em>, played in the fourteenth and
fifteenth centuries, it is nearly certain that at the
moment of their naïve representation of the Deluge,
the Deity appeared on the stage with an Umbrella
in his hand.</p>

<p>In the <em class="e000I2">Journal and Voyage of Montaigne</em> in Italy,
the good philosopher, who teaches us so few matters
beyond his own personal sufferings, deigns, nevertheless,
to aver that the supreme good taste of the
women of Lucca was to have incessantly a Parasol
in their hands.</p>

<p>“No season,” says also elsewhere this charming
epicurean essayist, “is so much my enemy as the
sharp heat of sunshine, for the <em class="e000I2">Sunshades</em>, which are
used in Italy since the time of the ancient Romans,
charge the arms more than they discharge from the
head.”</p>

<p>So, too, Thomas Coryat, an English tourist of that time, in his
<em class="e000I2">Crudities</em> (1611), speaks of the Italian
Parasols, after having noticed the presence of Fans in the towns
through which he had travelled: “Many Italians,” he says, “do carry
other fine things of a far greater price, that will cost at the
least a ducat (about seven francs), which they commonly call in the
Italian tongue <em class="e000I2">Umbrellæs</em>, that is, things
that minister shadow unto them for shelter against the scorching heat
of the sun. These are made of leather, something answerable to the
form of a little canopy, and hooped in the inside with divers little
wooden hoops, that extend the <em class="e000I2">Umbrella</em> in a
pretty large compass. They are used especially by horsemen, who carry
them in their hands when they ride, fastening the end of the handle
upon one of their thighs, and they impart so large a shadow unto them
that it keepeth the heat of the sun from the upper parts of their
body.”</p>

<p>Fabri, in his useful and remarkable work, <em class="e000I2">Diversarum Nationum
Ornatus</em> (additio) confirms this fact from 1593, in
taking care to represent a noble Italian, travelling on horseback with
a Parasol in his hand: “<em class="e000I2">Nobilis Italus ruri
ambulans tempore æstatis</em>.”</p>

<p>What variety this simple detail, more propagated or rather better
vulgarised among our romancists, would have thrown into the
great romances of adventure! We should have seen the protecting
Sunshade marking from a distance, by its colour and elevated
shape, the presence of the rich traveller to be robbed, in the
mountains of Tuscany, while the brigands of the time kept their
watch in the folds of the rocks; then, too, we should surely have
witnessed, in passionate recitals of heroic combats, the buckler
Parasol, already full of holes, torn into shreds, yet still serving to
parry victoriously the blows of the ferocious cut-throats and cloak-snatchers.</p>

<p>And how many sonorous and unforeseen titles are there of
which we have been deprived by this fact of our ignorance:
<em class="e000I2">The Knights of the Sunshade</em>—<em class="e000I2">The Heroic Parasol</em>—<em class="e000I2">The State
Courier</em>, or <em class="e000I2">the Sunshade Recovered</em>! . . . . and who can say
how many more!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_040.jpg" width="600" height="623" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The Arsenal, the old Hotel de Sully, preserved for a
long time one of those Parasols, which librarians named
the <em class="e000I2">Pepin</em> (seed-fruit) <em class="e000I2">of Henri IV.</em> It was very big,
and entirely covered with blue silk, with long and
distinctly precious flowers of the golden lily scattered
over it. This Parasol, ministerial or royal, is doubtless
lost, and we speak of it only after the description which
the learned bibliophile Jacob has given us.</p>

<p>Daniel Defoe, who published his <em class="e000I2">Robinson Crusoe</em> in 1719,
was one of the first to mention to any extent the Parasol in England.
Before him, as we shall see farther on, it had been named
only very summarily in literary works. So firmly fixed in our
imaginations as men, the children of yesterday, is the great
Umbrella of Crusoe, and his dreadful alarm on seeing the
print of a man’s foot on the shore, as well as his walks with
his dog and <em class="e000I2">Friday</em> the good Caribbee; it presents itself, moreover,
so clearly in our first literary remembrances, that we will
reproduce the passage of the journal where it is mentioned:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_041.jpg" width="600" height="663" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“After this,” says Crusoe, “I spent a deal of time and
pains to make me an Umbrella. I was indeed in great
want of one, and had a great mind to make one. I had
seen them made in the Brazils, where they are very
useful in the great heats which are there; and I felt
the heats every jot as great here, and greater too...;
besides, as I was obliged to be much abroad, it
was a most useful thing to me, as well for the
rains as the heats. I took a world of pains at it,
and was a great while before I could make anything
likely to hold; nay, after I thought I had
hit the way, I spoiled two or three before I made
one to my mind; but at last I made one that
answered indifferently well; the main difficulty, I
found, was to make it to let down: I could make it
to spread, but if it did not let down too, and draw
in, it would not be portable for me any way, but just
over my head, which would not do. However, at
last, as I said, I made one to answer; I covered it
with skins, the hair upward, so that it cast off the
rain like a pent-house, and kept off the sun so
effectually, that I could walk out in the hottest of
the weather, with greater advantage than I could
before in the coolest; and when I had no need of
it, I could close it and carry it under my arm.”</p>

<p>And this Parasol, for a century and a half, has
been popularised by the engraver, with its dome of
hair and rude manufacture; and so all the poor
little prisoners at school invoke it, and dream
often that they carry it in some desert isle, for
it represents to their eyes a life of open air and
liberty.</p>

<p>Before Daniel Defoe, Ben Jonson had already
mentioned the Parasol in England in a comedy
played in 1616; and Drayton, sending some doves
to his mistress in 1620—a delicious lover’s fancy—formulated
in his passioned verses the following
desire: “<em class="e000I2">May they, these white turtle doves I send
you, shelter you like Parasols under their wings in
every sort of weather.</em>”</p>

<p>In the relation of his <em class="e000I2">Voyage in France</em> in 1675,
Locke, speaking of Sunshades, says: “These are
little articles and very light, which women use
here, to defend themselves from the sun, and they
seem to us very convenient.” Afterwards the English
ladies desired to possess these pretty Parasols,
although, by reason of their climate, such things
could hardly be of any use to them. It was not,
however, till the eighteenth century that a London
manufacturer bethought himself of inventing the
Sunshade-Fan, compared with which it appears the
French folding <em class="e000I2">marquises</em> were as nothing. This
ingenious fabricator made a considerable fortune;
but if we are to believe the <em class="e000I2">Improvisateur François</em>,
his invention was rapidly imitated and much improved
in Paris. Why has it not been preserved
to our own days?</p>

<p>But let us linger in this seventeenth century, and
remain awhile in France, where the Parasol was
not in use, save at court among the great ladies.
Men never used it to shelter themselves from
the rain—the cloak and sword were still alone in
fashion.</p>

<p>Ménage tells us in his <em class="e000I2">Ménagiana</em>, that being
with M. de Beautru, about 1685, in the midst of a
pouring rain at the door of the Hôtel de Bourgogne,
up came a Gascon gentleman, without a
cloak, and nearly wet through; the Gascon, seeing
himself stared at, cried out, “I would
lay a wager now my people have forgotten
to give me my cloak.” To which M. de Beautru
quickly replied, “I go halves with you.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_044.jpg" width="600" height="436" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The silk Sunshade, however, properly so called, appeared in the
hands of women of quality, at the promenade, on the race-course,
or in the vast alleys of the royal park of Versailles, towards the
middle of the reign of Louis XIV. The Umbrella of that time was
an instrument astonishingly heavy and very coarse in appearance,
which it seemed almost ridiculous to hold in the hand. In 1622
it was in some measure a novelty in Paris, since in the <em
class="e000I2">Questions Tabariniques</em>, cited by that useful
author, the late M. Édouard Fournier, in <em class="e000I2">The Old
and the New</em>, we read these lines about the famous felt hat of
Tabarin:—</p>

<p>“It was from this hat that the invention of Parasols was drawn,
which are now so common in France that they are no longer called
Parasols, but <em class="e000I2">Parapluyes</em> (Umbrellas) and <em
class="e000I2">Garde-Collet</em> (collar guards), for they are used
as much in winter against the rain as in summer against the sun.”</p>

<p>The most ancient engraving or <em class="e000I2">documentary</em> image of
French manners in which we see a Parasol is dated 1620.
It is the frontispiece of a Collection of Saint Igny, <em class="e000I2">The
French Nobility at Church</em>.</p>

<p>Parasols, however, were still very little used in the seventeenth
century; the <em class="e000I2">Précieuses</em> who, instead of saying “It
rains,” cried out, “<em class="e000I2">The third element falls!</em>”
would never
have missed finding some amiable
qualificative to designate this necessary
article invented against Phœbus and Saint Swithin.
But Saumaise reveals to us nought on this subject,
and one would be almost tempted to believe that
the <em class="e000I2">Philamintes</em> and <em class="e000I2">Calpurnies</em> attached no importance
to this “rustic and movable Pavilion.” What,
however, is clearly shown by the ancient prints is
the employment of the Parasol in the form of a small round
canopy which ladies of quality had borne by their valets
when walking in the primly arranged gardens of their lordly
residences, whilst the gentlemen marched before, wrapt in
their cloaks, with the felt hat inclined over one eye.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_045.jpg" width="600" height="418" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Parasols were then of so coarse a form, and their weight
made them so difficult to be carried, that they could not
be easily utilised by ordinary people; they are never found
in any of those very curious engravings which give a confused
idea of the rumblings and mobs of the streets under
Louis XIV. Boileau and François Colletet have not mentioned
them amidst the <em class="e000I2">Obstacles and Bustle of Paris</em>; and
the <em class="e000I2">Cries of the Town</em> which have come down to us do
not indicate that in the seventeenth century any man with
“<em class="e000I2">’Brella-a-a-a-s to sell!</em>” had contributed his mournful
melopæa to the lagging cries of the street.</p>

<p>That is easily understood. We see that a Parasol, in
the middle of the grand century, weighed 1600 grammes,
that its whalebones had a length of 80 centimetres,
that its handle was of heavy oak, and that its massive
carcass was covered with oilcloth, with barracan,
or with coloured grogram. The whole was
held by a copper ring fixed at the extremity of
the whalebones; it was the labour of a porter to
preserve oneself, with an instrument like this, from
the pelting shower! Better still: often these Parasols
were made of straw, and, if we believe the
<em class="e000I2">Diary and Correspondence of Evelyn</em>, about 1650,
they affected in some degree the form of metal
dish-covers.</p>

<p>However, it is something very like a Sunshade
which we find about 1688 in the hands of a woman
of quality, dressed in a summer habit <em class="e000I2">à la Grecque</em>,
of which N. Arnoult has preserved faithfully for
us the pleasing outline, in a pretty design made
common by engravings. This Parasol has the
appearance of a mushroom, well developed and
slightly flattened at its borders; the red velvet
which covers it is divided into ribs or rays, by
light girdles of gold, and the handle, very curiously
worked, is like that of a distaff, with swellings and
grooves executed by the turner. Altogether, this
coquette’s Sunshade is very graceful, and of great
richness.</p>

<p>In the most varied literary works of the seventeenth
century, memoirs, romances, varieties, dissertations,
poems, enigmas, carols, and songs, there
is not a word of allusion to the Parasol, there is an
entire penury of anecdote, nothing whatever on the
subject. It is useless to torture your understanding,
to look through a miserable needle’s eye, at
the <em class="e000I2">Letters</em> of Madame de Sévigné, the gossip of
Tallemant, the <em class="e000I2">Conversations</em> of Mademoiselle de
Scudéry, the <em class="e000I2">Anecdotes</em> of Ménage, the poetical collections,
the different <em class="e000I2">Chats</em>, the <em class="e000I2">Medleys</em>—it is but
a library overturned to no purpose, a headache
gained without the slightest profit.</p>

<p>In a MS. collection, written about 1676, which
relates the memoirs of Nicolas Barillon, a comedian,
this phrase alone attracts our attention: “The days
being very hot, the lady carried either a mask or a
Parasol of the most precious leather.”</p>

<p>From this mask or Parasol of precious leather
no conclusion can be drawn better than that of the
Dictionaries of the Anti-Academician, Antoine
Furetière, or of the learned Richelet, where we find
a résumé of the ideas of the time. Here, then, is
the definition of the first:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em class="e000I2">Parasol</em>, s. m., a small portable piece
of furniture, or round covering, carried in the hand, to defend the
head from the great heats of the sun; it is made of a circle of
leather, of taffety, of oilcloth, &#38;c. It is suspended to the
end of a stick; it is folded or extended by means of some ribs of
whalebone which sustain it. It serves also to defend one from the
rain, and then it is called by some <em class="e000I2">parapluie</em>
(umbrella).</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_048.jpg" width="600" height="620" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The definition of Richelet is almost the same. He adds, however,
these words: “Only women carry Parasols, and they only in spring,
summer, and autumn.” Richelet, it is true, borders upon the
eighteenth century, since he died but a little before the end of
the reign of Louis the Great. This brings us to the aurora of the
Regency, and a renaissance then occurs in feminine coquetry. We are
now about to find our Sunshade in gallant parties, supported by
little turbaned negroes; already we see it decorated with fringes of
gold and trimmings of silk, enhanced with plumes of feathers, mounted
on Indian bamboos, covered with changing silks, embellished in a
thousand and one ways, worthy, in a word, of casting a discreet shade
on those rosy and delicate faces which Pater, Vanloo, Lancret, La
Rosalba, and Latour did their best to reproduce in luminous paintings
or fresh pastels, those enchanting pictures where the coquetry of the
past smiles still.</p>

<p>Like all objects of adornment in the hands of women, the
Sunshade in the last century became, like the Fan, almost a
light and graceful plaything, serving to punctuate an expression,
to round a gesture,
to arm an attitude of
charming reverie, in
which, guided by pretty indolent
fingers, its point traces
vague designs upon the sand.
Before the burning breath of amorous
declarations, often the frail Sunshade
escapes from the hands of a
beauty, in sign of armistice, and as an
avowal of abandonment.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_049.jpg" width="600" height="623" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Be it open, and daintily held over powdered
hair, or shut, and brushing the brocaded petticoat, it is always
the “balancing pole of the Graces.” It gives a value to listlessness
on the rustic seat of the parks, under the vaulted roofs
of grottoes, and it adds a piquancy to the frowardness of the
feminine chatterers, who defend themselves by making fun of
libertine attacks. In a word, in the light amorous allegories
of the century, it is worthy to appear in those love-duets of
<em class="e000I2">Leanders</em> and <em class="e000I2">Isabellas</em>, which Watteau often composed with so
rare an art of refinement.</p>

<p>From the middle of the last century the Umbrella of taffety
became the fashion at Paris. Caraccioli, in his <em class="e000I2">Picturesque
and Sententious Dictionary</em>, gives us evidence of this: “It has
long been the custom,” he says, “not to go out
save with one’s Umbrella, and to trouble oneself by
carrying it under one’s arm. Those who wish not
to be confounded with the vulgar, prefer to run the
risk of getting wet to being regarded as people who
walk on foot, for the Umbrella is the sign of having
no carriage.”</p>

<p>The Parasols were made by the purse-makers,
and when, by an edict of August 1776, the manufacturers
of gloves, purses, and girdles were united
in one community, an article thus conceived may
be read in their statutes: “They alone also still
have the right to make and manufacture all sorts
of Umbrellas and Parasols, in whalebone and in
copper, folding and non-folding, to garnish them
atop with stuffs of silk and linen, to make Umbrellas
of oilcloth, and Parasols adorned and
ornamented in all sorts of fashions.” According
to the <em class="e000I2">Journal of a Citizen</em>, published at the
Hague in 1754, the price of folding Parasols was
then from 15 to 22 livres a piece, and the Parasol
for the country from 9 to 14 livres.</p>

<p>We must, however, believe that the common
folk of Paris did not yet dare to purchase Parasols,
since Bachaumont, in the <em class="e000I2">Secret Memoirs</em>, dated
6th September 1769, records the following enterprise:—</p>

<p>“A company has lately formed an establishment
worthy of the town of Sybaris. It has obtained an
exclusive privilege to have Parasols, and to furnish
them to such as fear being incommoded by the
sun during the crossing of the Pont-Neuf. There
are to be offices at each extremity of the bridge,
where the voluptuous dandies who are unwilling
to spoil their complexion, can obtain this useful
machine; they will return it at the office on the
other side, so alternately, at the price of two farthings
for each person. This project has already
been put in execution. It is announced that if
this invention succeeds, there is authority to establish
like offices in other places in Paris, where
skulls might be affected, such as the Place Louis
XV., &#38;c. It is probable that these profound speculators
will obtain the exclusive privilege of Umbrellas.”</p>

<p>Did this enterprise succeed? We cannot tell.
All that is certain is, that it was tried many times in
our own epoch by innovators, who had no idea that
even the letting out of Parasols was not absolutely
new under the sun.</p>

<p>A great progress was realised in the eighteenth century in the
manufacture of Sunshades for ladies. The small ordinary Parasols
became exceedingly light, and charmingly decorated. In a picture of
Bonaventure Delord, in the Louvre, we find the exact type of these
coquettish Sunshades of the last century. One, which is held by a
laughing beauty in the midst of a picnic, is mounted on a long stem,
and the top, made of yellow buckskin, appears to have four sides; a
cap of turned copper, and of a very pretty shape, profiles its tiny
Chinese gable on the grass.</p>

<p>So, too, may be seen in the collection of Madame la Baronne
Gustave de Rothschild, a very curious Sunshade which belonged to
Madame de Pompadour. It is of blue silk superbly decorated with
wonderful Chinese miniatures in mica, and ornaments in paper very
finely cut and affixed to the background. Fortified probably with
such a Sunshade as this, the pretty favourite, at the time of the
rage for pastorals, which followed the appearance of Bouffier’s story
of <em class="e000I2">Aline</em>, betook herself to the shady walks
of the Petit Trianon at Versailles, with her female friends, to see
the white sheep milked, and to steep the carnation of her lips in
the warm milk, of which the young Abbé De Bernis—who gathered so
willingly madrigals and bouquets for Chloris—compared the whiteness
to that of her peerless bosom.</p></div>

<p>Everywhere, in the pictures and engravings of the century
we catch a glimpse of these same light Sunshades or Umbrellas
which approach so nearly those of the present day. We see
the one or the other in the <em class="e000I2">Prints of Moreau the Younger
intended to serve as a Companion to the History of Fashions and
Customs in France</em>, in the <em class="e000I2">Crossing the River</em>, after Gamier, in
public festivals, as well as amidst the hubbub of the crowds,
which Moreau shows us in the <em class="e000I2">Great Court Carriages in</em> 1782,
as in the minor popular rejoicings, like <em class="e000I2">The Ascension of a
Fire-balloon</em>, after the engravings of the period. The Sunshade
introduces also a little touch of gaiety into the large pictures
of Joseph Vernet; in his <em class="e000I2">View of Antibes</em> and his <em class="e000I2">Port of
Marseille</em> the painter has placed in the hands of pretty promenaders
adorable little pink Sunshades, through which
the light seems to filtrate, in the silk’s transparency.
Later on, lastly, before the royal sitting of 23d June,
1789, the Umbrella plays its historic part in the Revolution,
by protecting the gentlemen of the Third Estate,
left at the door of the Assembly under a pelting rain,
not very well disposed to receive the King’s order,
“Gentlemen, I command you to disperse yourselves at
once!”</p>

<p>Strange! at a time when the Parasol was generally
adopted in France, it was yet very little known
in England and among the peoples of the North.
At Venice even, where we have made our researches,
the first person who used a Sunshade,
about the middle of the eighteenth century, was
Michel Morosini, “a senator of high rank,” who,
braving all prejudices, appeared one day in his gondola,
bearing a small green Sunshade, unarched, of
a quadrangular form, surmounted by a tiny copper
spire, of very delicate workmanship. The fair
ladies of Venice adopted this “indispensable” after
this manifestation of the noble Michel Morosini,
but the Sunshade, nevertheless, appeared not in all
patrician hands in the gondolas of the Great Canal,
and on the Piazza of Saint Mark, till about the year
1760.</p>

<p>In England, in the first half of the last century,
the Parasol and the Umbrella were hardly ever
used; however, in a passage of the <em class="e000I2">Tatler</em>, Swift
alludes to one of them in 1760, when he describes
for us a little sempstress, with her petticoats tucked
up, and walking along in a great hurry, whilst the
rain trickles down from the Umbrella:</p>

<div class="poembox">
<p class="pi0">The tucked-up sempstress walks with hasty strides,</p>
<p class="pi0">While streams run down her oiled Umbrella’s sides.</p>
</div>

<p>Again, there is at Woburn Abbey an admirable
portrait, painted about 1730, of the Duchess of
Bedford, followed by a little negro, who holds above
her head a sumptuously decorated state Parasol.</p>

<p>It is right to say that during the first years of the
last century people could not procure Umbrellas in
London except in the coffee-houses, where they
were placed in reserve to be let out to customers
during heavy showers of rain. The first English
citizen who really introduced absolutely and unconditionally
the Umbrella to the nation was Jonas
Hanway, the founder of the Magdalen Hospital.
This audacious man—for audacious he must have
been thus to brave the prejudices of a people the
most prejudiced in the world—this rash person
had the courage never to go out into the streets of
London without his Umbrella from the year of our
Lord 1750. Like the majority of innovators, he
was scoffed at, reviled, derided, caricatured; he had
to bear in his daily walks the quips and insults of
the mob, the stones and jostlings of the vagabond
boys; but he had also the honour of triumphing,
and of seeing by degrees, after twenty years of perseverance,
his example followed to such an extent
that at the time of his death in 1786 he could declare
with pride that, thanks to him, the Umbrella
was for ever implanted in England, an imperishable
institution.</p>

<p>To-day, our neighbours across the Channel talk
of erecting a statue to Jonas Hanway, as a homage
publicly paid to a philanthropist. It might be asked in
what attitude this peaceable humanitarian is to be represented,
whether the Parasol of bronze is to remain shut up
in his right hand, or if it will be opened in all its amplitude
over the head of its protector, thus become its <em class="e000I2">protégé</em>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_056.jpg" width="600" height="348" alt="" />
</div>

<p>About the time when Jonas Hanway died, Roland de la
Platière made, in his <em class="e000I2">Manufactures, Arts, and Trades</em>, this
curious observation: “The use of Parasols is to such an
extent established in Lyons, that not only all the women,
but even the men, would not cross the street without their
little Parasol in red, white, or some other colour, garnished
with blonde lace, an article which, owing to its lightness,
can be carried with ease.”</p>

<p>At the approach of the Revolution, the Umbrella became
popular, and served as a tent for the fishwomen and other
feminine hucksters. Then first appeared the enormous Umbrella
of red serge among the people of the markets, and the
ordinary Umbrella in the hands of the “Sans-Jupons” (the
unpetticoated). Amidst the enthusiasms and revolts of the
streets the Umbrella was frantically waved by the hands of
the women of the people, and when, on the 31st May 1793,
Théroigne de Méricourt undertook her ill-starred defence of
Brissot, in the midst of a multitude of old hags, who cried
“Down with the Brissotins!” Umbrellas were lifted like so
many improvised swords over the <em class="e000I2">Liégeoise</em>, smote her in the
face, lashed her everywhere, scanning as it were with their
strokes the odious cries of “<em class="e000I2">Ah!
the Brissotine!</em>” and
provoking in the unhappy revolutionary Amazon the madness
of which she died so sadly at the Salpêtrière.</p>

<p>The Parasol of the Jacobins for a time made a show of severity,
in opposition to the knotty sticks and coquettish Parasols of the
Muscadins (dandies) and Incroyables (beaux); the Merveilleuses
(feminine exquisites), on the other hand, hoisted vaporous Sunshades
like their vestments of nymphs. Then it was that fashion gave their
due to the rights even of this frail protector of the Graces; every
kind of extravagance was allowed, every stuff accepted, however
dazzling and however precious. In the public gardens of Paris, all
the fashionable beauties displayed unusual luxury in the decoration
of their Sunshades; there were tender greens, figured gold stuffs,
flesh-coloured tints with scarlet fretworks, tender blues trimmed
with silver, Indian cashmeres or tissues, the whole mounted on
handles of affected roughness or of exquisitely delicate work. <em
class="e000I2">Ma paole supême</em>, as the exquisite used to say, it
must be seen to be believed. Nothing could be more coquettish than
these Parasols, streaked, striped, pied, fretted, as the complement
of a dress <em class="e000I2">à l’Omphale</em>, <em class="e000I2">à
la Flore</em>, <em class="e000I2">à la Diane</em>, appearing in
a swiftly driven carriage, above a jacket <em class="e000I2">à
la Galatée</em>, or a tunic <em class="e000I2">au Lever de
l’aurore</em>, amidst egrets, plumes, tufts of ribbons, and every
kind of feminine adornment.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"> <img
src="images/i_057.jpg" width="600" height="331" alt="" /> </div>

<p>Towards the close of the eighteenth century, the Sunshade was
always covered with the most fashionable tints and with stuff of
the latest taste of the time. Parasols were to be seen dressed
in <em class="e000I2">stifled sighs</em>, and garnished with <em
class="e000I2">useless regrets</em>, others adorned with ribbons <em
class="e000I2">aux soupirs de Vénus</em> (Venus’ sighs), whilst the
fashion exacted by turns such colours as <em class="e000I2">coxcombs’
bowels</em>, <em class="e000I2">Paris mud</em>, <em
class="e000I2">Carmelite</em>, <em class="e000I2">flea’s thigh</em>,
<em class="e000I2">king’s eye</em>, <em class="e000I2">queen’s
hair</em>, <em class="e000I2">goose dung</em>, <em
class="e000I2">dauphin’s dirt</em>, <em class="e000I2">opera
flame</em>, <em class="e000I2">agitated nymph’s thigh</em>, and other
names which were the singular qualificatives of particular shades,
the rage and infatuation of the hour.</p>

<p>The young priests carried a light violet or lilac
Parasol, to remain in the tone of their general
dress—perhaps by episcopal orders. In the
same way, the Roman Cardinals are still followed
in their walks by a deacon, carrying a red Parasol,
which makes part—like the hat—of the ordinary
luggage of the “Monsignori.”</p>

<p>This word “luggage,” which has just fallen from our pen, would
seem to call the attention to the rôle of the Sunshade or the
Umbrella in the Travels of the last century. Was the Parasol
considered as indispensable luggage before going on any expedition?
We cannot affirm this. The author of <em class="e000I2">A Journey
from Paris to Saint-Cloud by Sea and by Land</em> writes, before
embarking at Pont-Royal: “I kept for my personal carriage only
my repeater, my pocket-flask full of <em class="e000I2">sans
pareille</em> water, my gloves, my boots, a whip, my riding-coat,
my pocket pistols, my fox-skin muff, my green taffety Umbrella, and
my big varnished walking-stick.” But here we have more of a pretty
conceit of the eighteenth century, a sort of cotquean traveller,
who encumbers himself with useless objects. We have consulted many
<em class="e000I2">Almanacks serving as Guides for Travellers</em>,
and containing “a detail of everything which is necessary to travel
comfortably, usefully, and agreeably,” from 1760 to 1765: nowhere,
however, was the Umbrella prescribed, either for foot passengers
or for those on horseback; on the contrary, the anonymous editor
of those guides seems sometimes to laugh at the simplicity of the
tourist from Paris to Saint-Cloud, and he adds that a traveller in
good health ought to content himself with strong boots and a cloak of
good cloth. Even a walking-stick, he says, often consoles the walker
only in imagination.</p>

<p>The Umbrella-Walking-stick—who would believe
it?—was, however, known from 1758, and very
convenient Parasols were then made, of which the
dimensions could be reduced so as to suit the
pocket. A certain Reynard announced in 1761
Parasols “which fold on themselves triangularly,
and become no thicker or more voluminous than
a crush-hat.” These Umbrellas were, it seems,
very common about 1770: the stick was in two
pieces, united by a screw, and the ribs were folded
back several times.</p>

<p>But let us not abandon the chronological order in returning
thus upon our own steps, after the example of a romance
writer of 1840. We have scarcely caught a glimpse of the
Sunshade in our passage through the sixteenth, seventeenth,
and eighteenth centuries, in the desultory speed of this free
chat, in which our prose leaps as in a steeple-chase of
charming designs. We have confounded occasionally the
two denominations <em class="e000I2">Sunshade</em> and <em class="e000I2">Umbrella</em> in the more
general word <em class="e000I2">Parasol</em>: but if we have travelled a little in
every direction, we have not had the leisure to stop anywhere
as a lounger or analyst. And here we are at the
beginning of this century, at the Empire, but the nation is
helmed, the sun of Austerlitz requires not a Sunshade;
woman holds merely the second place in this hour in which
France handles but the costly toys of glory, and if
we find at all an Umbrella, it is in the field, with
the general staff of the army, during some
misty night, when it is used to shelter the
commander-in-chief, who studies on his map
the plan of battle of the morn.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<img src="images/i_061.jpg" width="599" height="305" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The Sunshade shows more favourably in the hour of
peace, during the Restoration. All the journals of fashion
of the time give us curious and varied specimens of it
in their steel engravings, hand-coloured, which show us,
during those days of a lull, languid ladies in the midst
of amusing decorations, in winter amidst snowy country
scenes, in summer in a park of profound distances, on
some rustic bridge, where the mistresses of the manors
of that time allowed their romantic reveries slowly to
wander. We can follow in the innumerable Monitors of
elegance, which appeared from 1815 to 1830, from year
to year, from season to season, the variations introduced
into the decoration of the little ladies’ Parasols. Look
for a moment: here are Sunshades, covered with coloured
crape, or damasked satin, with checkered silk, streaked,
striped, or figured; others enriched with blonde or lace,
embroidered with glass-trinkets, or garnished with marabou
feathers, with gold and silver lace, or silk trimming; the
fashionable shade is then very light or very deep, without
intermediate tones: white, straw yellow, pink or myrtle-green,
chestnut and black, purple-red, or indigo. But a
hundred pages would not suffice us to catalogue these
fashions of the Sunshade: let us pass onward.</p>

<p>The use of the Umbrella extends itself little by little
through all classes; already in the slang of the people it is
known under the names of the <em class="e000I2">Mauve</em>(?), the <em class="e000I2">Riflard</em>, the
<em class="e000I2">Pépin</em>, the <em class="e000I2">Robinson</em>. Umbrella manufactories have, since
the beginning of this century, propagated rapidly in France.
Before 1815—this seems scarcely credible—Paris had no
great manufactory of Parasols. But from 1808
to 1851 alone, we can reckon more than 103
patents for inventions and improvements relating
to Umbrellas and Sunshades. Among the most
extravagant patents, we must quote, after M.
Cazal:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(1.) A patent for invention of an Umbrella walking-stick
with a field-glass;</p>

<p>(2.) A patent for invention of Umbrellas and Sunshades
combined with walking-sticks, shutting up in a copper case,
in the form of a telescope;</p>

<p>(3.) A patent for invention of an Umbrella walking-stick,
containing diverse objects for writing or other purposes, and
called <em class="e000I2">Universal Walking-stick</em>;</p>

<p>(4.) A patent for invention of methods of manufacturing
Umbrellas and Sunshades, opening of themselves, by means
of a mechanism placed inside the handle;</p>

<p>(5.) A patent for an Umbrella walking-stick, of which
the sheath may be folded at pleasure, and carried in the
pocket.</p></div>

<p>In spite of these genially grotesque inventions
of Umbrella-Telescopes and of Parasol-Walking-sticks,
we have always come back to the Umbrella
simple, without mechanism, or to a light stick
without any pretensions to defend us from the
rain. There are so many complications in an
object intended for many uses, that an educated
mind will always refuse to adopt it.</p>

<p>But without speaking further of the technology
of the Umbrella, we will relate an anecdote which
ran through all the minor journals of the Restoration,
terminating like an apologue. We shall adopt
the form and style of the time in our narrative of
this little historic story, which should be entitled
<em class="e000I2">The Sunshade and the Riflard</em>.</p>

<p>One fair summer afternoon, the promenaders
in the Parisian Champs Elysées might have seen,
seated on a chair beside a pretty woman, whose
interesting situation was plainly visible, a peaceable
citizen making an inventory of all his pockets in
their turn, without finding the purse from which
he intended to draw the few halfpence which the
chair-proprietress demanded.</p>

<p>The search is useless; it is impossible for him
to pay;—the proprietress indignant, almost rude,
threatening to make a disturbance, is only satisfied
by the gentleman taking from the hands of his
companion a Sunshade of green silk, with fringes,
mounted on a reed, and a yellow glove, and giving
them to the irascible lady, saying to her, “Well,
madam, keep this Sunshade as a pledge, and give
it to no one unless he offer you a Glove the fellow
of this.”</p>

<p>The pair departed, slowly arrived at the Place de
la Révolution, then at the Boulevard de la Madeleine,
when they were surprised by a violent shower;
cabs were not to be had, the rain increased, they
were forced to seek refuge underneath a carriage
entrance. The peaceable citizen had already taken
his companion to this shelter, when a “portier,” with
an otter-skin cap, came out, beseeching the lady and
gentleman to accept the hospitality of his little room,
where a leathern arm-chair and a stool were immediately,
and with very good grace, offered to the invited pair.
The rain still pouring down, the “portier,” more and more
affable, took from a corner of his small lodge a superb
Umbrella of green serge, and offered it to his guests,
declaring that all he had was at their service.</p>

<p>The gentleman, in much confusion, accepted with
many thanks the Umbrella, and sheltering with it the
interesting young woman, who had tucked up her dress
in the prettiest style, they both ventured out into the
midst of the deluge.</p>

<p> . . . . An hour afterwards, a footman in very stylish
livery returned to the honest “portier” cobbler his
precious Umbrella, with four notes for a thousand
francs, from the Duke de Berry; next directing his course
to the Champs Elysées, that same footman sought out the
chair-proprietress, and said to her:</p>

<p>“You recognise this Glove, Madam? Here are four pence,
which my lord, the Duke of Berry, has ordered me to remit
to you, to redeem the Sunshade of the Princess Caroline.”</p>

<p>Touching and eternal legend of virtue, not without a
recompense!</p></div>

<p>Under Louis Philippe, the Umbrella or Riflard became
<em class="e000I2">patriarchal</em> and <em class="e000I2">constitutional</em>; it represented manners austere
and citizenlike, and symbolised the domestic virtues of order
and economy. It might be set in the royal trophy in saltier
with the sceptre, and it became a part in some sort of the
national militia, with the attributes of angling, culinary laurels,
and other symbols of Philistine life.</p>

<p>All the independents of Paris, Bohemians, literary men with
flowing manes, and artists chanted in the <em class="e000I2">Rapinéide</em>, all the
hirsute folk of the years 1830 to 1850 rose in insurrection
against the “Pépin” of the burgess. This word <em class="e000I2">Pépin</em> was
then an epigram against Louis Philippe, whose pear-shaped
head was caricatured, and who never left his home without
his Umbrella.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_065.jpg" width="600" height="546" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Anglomania had not yet penetrated, as in the present
day, into French manners; and the dandyism of 1830,
which pretended that the carrying of a walking-stick required
a particular skill, repelled the Umbrella as contrary
to veritable elegance. The Umbrella was countrified, the
property of gaffer and gammer; it was tolerable only in
the hands of one who had long renounced all pretensions
to any charm, and dreamed no more of setting off in the
promenade the haughty profile of a conqueror. In the
cross ways, in every public place in Paris, the large Parasol,
red, or the colour of wine-lees, had become, as it were,
the ensign of the strolling singer who retailed Béranger to
the crowd; it served as a shelter for acrobats in
the open air; it surmounted the improvised
trestles of the sellers of tripoli, of an universal
ointment; it ascended even the chariot of
the quacks; later on it served as a set-off for
the plumed helmet of
Mangin, the pencil
merchant; and it is still under a copper Parasol,
commonly called <em class="e000I2">Chinese bells</em>, that the man-orchestra
causes an excitement in the court-yards by ringing
his little bells.</p>

<p>In the provinces, on market or great fair days,
the Umbrellas opened in picturesque confusion
above the flat baskets and provisional establishments
of the country women; there were red,
faded blue or chestnut ones, inexpressible green or
old family Umbrellas, heirlooms descended from
generation to generation, which protected the little
rural tradeswomen, and added a particular character
full of colour to these primitive markets of little
towns.</p>

<p>The Umbrella! we behold it in the dreams of
our school-days. Here is the severe and sombre
Umbrella of the headmaster, symbol of his pedantic
authority, when he passed us in review in the cold
and damp playground. Here is the Riflard of the
poor usher, a celebrated <em class="e000I2">Pépin</em>, covered with a
mottled cotton-stuff, its bill-headed handle polished
by his unctuous clasp. And here, above all, is
an Umbrella greeted with loud acclaim, a festive
Crusoe, which followed us when out walking,
as the sutler follows the regiment on the march,
the Umbrella of <em class="e000I2">Mother Sun</em>, as we used to call
it: <em class="e000I2">Mother Sun!</em> an honest jolly wench, with her
head in a silk pocket-handkerchief tied under
her chin, who installed herself beneath the
shelter of her improvised tent about our playtime,
to sell to her noisy <em class="e000I2">children</em> cooling lemonade,
fruit, barley-sugar, and little white rolls stuffed with
hot sausages.</p>

<p>But let us leave these souvenirs, which carry us
too far away, and return to the <em class="e000I2">Sunshade</em> between
1830 and 1870. If we wished to show only its
transformations during these forty years, we should
have to write a volume quite full of coloured
vignettes to give a feeble idea of the history which
fashion creates in an object of coquetry. About
1834, in the journal called <em class="e000I2">Le Protée</em>, we see
fashion personified under the traits of a young
and pretty woman visiting the finest shops in
Paris; she fails not to go to “Verdier, in the
Rue Richelieu, for Sunshades,” and chooses two—one
a full-dress Sunshade, in unbleached silk
casing, mounted on a stick of American bindweed,
with a top of gold and carved coral; the
other in striped wood, having a similar top with
a fluted knob, and covered with myrtle green
paduasoy, with a satin border.</p>

<p>Let us skip over some hundreds of intermediate
varieties to look a dozen years afterwards, under
the Second Republic, at the Sunshade described
by M. A. Challamel in his <em class="e000I2">History of Fashion</em>:
“As soon,” says this writer, “as the first ray of
sunshine appeared, ladies armed themselves for
their walks or morning calls with little Sunshades,
entirely white, or pink, or green. Sometimes the
Sunshades called ‘Marquises’ were edged with
lace, which gave them rather a ragged appearance;
or having the shape of little Umbrellas,
the Sunshades could serve at need against a sudden storm.
Very soon we saw Sunshades <em class="e000I2">à dispositions</em> bordered with
a figured garland, or a satin stripe of the same colours,
or blue or green on unbleached silk, or violet on white
or sulphur.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_068.jpg" width="600" height="284" alt="" />
</div>

<p>A fashion, not, it will be allowed, in the very best
taste:—Up to 1853 or 1854, we find no innovation
worthy of exciting our enthusiasm; it is only in the first
days of the Second Empire that we can see a marked
change. The straight Sunshades were then abandoned to
introduce Sunshades with a folding stick, principally for
those made in satin and in moire antique, bordered with
trimmings or set off with streamers. These Sunshades
were called “<em class="e000I2">à la Pompadour</em>,” and they were worthy, in
a certain degree, of the beauty who personified grace and
delicate elegance in the eighteenth century; they were
embroidered after the old fashion with gold and silk, and
on the richness of the stuffs was cast or “frilled in” Chantilly,
point d’Alençon, guipure, or blonde. The folding-sticks
were of sculptured ivory, of carved mother-of-pearl,
of rhinoceros horn, or of tortoise-shell. It is with this
light Sunshade that the Parisian ladies saluted the Empress,
caracoling by the side of the Emperor, at the commencement
of his reign, on their return from the Wood, in the Champs
Elysées, which began to look beautiful, as everything looks
beautiful at the spring-tide of years, as well as at the springtime
of governments. All in nature has surely its fall of the
leaf, after having had the verdure of its blossom!—all tires,
all passes, all breaks: men, kings, fashions, and peoples!</p>

<p>The Sunshade is found to-day in the hands of every one,
as it should be in this practical and utilitarian age. There
is not, at the present hour, any woman or girl of the people,
who has not her sunshade or her satin <em class="e000I2">en-tout-cas</em>—it seems
to be the indispensable complement of the toilet for the
promenade; and our modern painters have so well understood
this gracious adjunct of feminine costume, that they
take very good heed not to forget, in a study of a woman
made in a full light, a rosy head with dishevelled hair, on
the transparent ground of a Japanese Sunshade, thus producing
an exquisite work with all freshness of colouring,
and discreet shadows sifted upon sparkling eyes or a
laughing mouth. On Sundays and holidays, in the jostlings
of the crowd at suburban fêtes, it is like an eddy
of Sunshades; such the spectacle of ancient besiegers, who
covered themselves with their bucklers and made the
“tortoise,” so in the shimmer of the summer sun in the
great Parisian parish festivals: gingerbread fairs of Saint-Cloud
or Vaugirard, the Sunshade is on the trestles and
among the promenaders; it protects equally the girl dancing
on the tight-rope and the respectable citizen’s wife in her
Sunday best, who rumples the flounce of her petticoats in
these popular gatherings.</p>

<p>Surely the Sunshade adds new graces to woman! It is
her outside weapon, which she bears boldly as a volunteer,
either at her side, or inclined over her shoulder. It
protects her head-dress, in supporting her carriage,
it surrounds as with a halo the charms of her face.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_069.jpg" width="600" height="464" alt="" />

<p>“The Sunshade,” writes M. Cazal—or rather
Marchal, as the so-called Charles de Bussy, who
edited, in the name of the manufacturer, the little
work already quoted,—“the Sunshade, like a rosy
vapour, attenuates and softens the contour of the
features, revives the vanished tints, surrounds the
physiognomy with its diaphanous reflections. There
is the Sunshade of the great lady, of the young
person, of the tradesman’s wife, of the pretty
lorette, of the little workwoman, just as there
is the Sunshade of the town, of the country, of
the garden, of the bath, of the barouche, and the
Sunshade-whip.”</p>

<p>“How many volumes,” continues the same
writer with animation, “would be required to
describe in its thousand fantasies the kaleidoscope
of feminine thought in the use of the Sunshade?
Under its rosy or azure dome, sentiment
buds, passion broods or blossoms; at a distance
the Sunshade calls and rallies to its colours, near
at hand it edifies the curious eye, and disconcerts
and repels presumption. How many sweet smiles
have played under its corolla! How many charming
signs of the head, how many intoxicating and
magic looks, has the Sunshade protected from
jealousy and indiscretion! How many emotions,
how many dramas, has it hidden with its cloud of silk!”</p>

<p>M. Charles Blanc, less dithyrambic, in his <em class="e000I2">Art
in Dress and Ornament</em>, commences his chapter
on the Sunshade—“Do you imagine that women
have invented it to preserve their complexion from
the heats of the sun? . . . . Certainly, without doubt;
but how many resources are furnished them by this
need of casting a penumbra over their face, and
what a grudge they would have against the sun,
if it gave them no pretext for defending themselves
against his rays! In that work of art called
a woman’s toilet, the Sunshade sustains the part of
the chiaro-oscuro.</p>

<p>“In the play of colours it is as a glazing. In
the play of light it is as a blind.”</p>

<p>For the last dozen years, fashion has varied,
with every new season, the mode and covering
of Sunshades. To-day they have become artistic
in all points, and after having been in turns in
spotted foulard, and set off with ribbons or lace,
after the Parasol walking-stick, the maroon or cardinal-red
Parasol, have succeeded the checkered
taffetas, the Madras cretonnes, the Pompadour
satins, the figured silks. Their handles are
adorned with porcelain of Dresden, of Sèvres, or
of Longwy, with various precious stones, and with
jewels of all sorts; and lately, among some wedding
presents, amidst a dozen Sunshades, one
remarkable specimen was entirely covered with
point lace, on a pink ground clouded with white
gauze, having a jade handle with incrustations of
precious stones up to its extreme point. A golden ring
gemmed with emeralds and brilliants, attached to a gold
chain, served as a clasp for this inestimable jewel.</p>

<p>But in this style of hasty conference in which we are
running from the Sunshade to the Umbrella, let us not
neglect the latter, whose last name is <em class="e000I2">paratrombe</em> and
<em class="e000I2">paradéluge</em>, which M. de Balzac, in the <em class="e000I2">Père Goriot</em>, calls
“a bastard descended from a cane and a walking-stick.”
The Umbrella has inspired many writers—writers of vaudevilles,
romances, poetry, and humorous pieces; on it little
ingenious monographs have been composed, little sparkling
verses, articles in reviews, very serious from the trade point
of view; many couplets have been rhymed at the Caveau and
elsewhere on the Pépin and the Riflard; on the stage has
been interpreted <em class="e000I2">My Wife and My Umbrella</em>, <em class="e000I2">Oscar’s Umbrella</em>,
<em class="e000I2">The Umbrella of Damocles</em>, and <em class="e000I2">the Umbrella</em>
of the poet D’Hervilly. This useful article
has also inspired the realist Champfleury in
a joyous tale, entitled—<em class="e000I2">Above all, don’t forget
your Umbrella!</em> Everywhere, with variations
and unheard-of paraphrases, has the social part
of the Umbrella been shown to us; the meetings
occasioned by it on stormy days; the <em class="e000I2">Pépin</em>
gallantly offered to young girls eating apples in
distress whilst it is raining on the Boulevards; we
have had described to us the gentleman who
follows the ladies fortified with his Umbrella,
the weapon of his fight, and
many tales and novels begin
with one of these Parisian
meetings at a street corner on
a wet evening. The utility
of the Umbrella in different
ways has been insisted on, of
the painter’s Umbrella, of the
Umbrella for men called <em class="e000I2">sea
bath</em>; and the sad melopæa of
the French seller of Umbrellas
in the street, whose prolonged
cry of <em class="e000I2">parrrphluie</em> has been
carefully annotated. Lastly,
there have been too many pictures
representing a coquettish
workwoman, whose petticoats
have been turned up by the wind, and whose Parasol has
been turned inside out; but that which has never been
written with the humour which such a subject allows, the
master-piece which has never yet been accomplished, is the
<em class="e000I2">Physiology of the Umbrella</em>.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that bibliographers will put under our
eyes a thin book of the lowest character which affects this
title, and is edited by <em class="e000I2">Two Hackney Coachmen</em>, but it is
nought but the “humbug” of the Umbrella—its <em class="e000I2">Physiology</em>
in its entirety is yet unaccomplished. Balzac would
have found therein matter for an immortal work, for
there is a dash of truth in that fantastic aphorism uttered
by some journalist in distress, “The Umbrella is the
man.”</p>

<p>Eugène Scribe has left us a modest quatrain on
the Umbrella, worthy of his operatic muse—</p>

<div class="poembox">
<p class="pi0">A friend of mine, new, true, and rare,</p>
<p class="pi1">And all unlike the common form;</p>
<p class="pi0">Who leaves me when my sky is fair,</p>
<p class="pi1">And reappears in days of storm.</p></div>

<p>This almost equals that other quatrain, more ancient still, signed by
the good abbé Delille—</p>

<div class="poembox">
<p class="pi0">This precious, supple instrument, confect</p>
<p class="pi1">Of the whale’s bone, and of the silkworm’s grave,</p>
<p class="pi0">With outstretched wing, my brow will oft protect</p>
<p class="pi1">From the wet onslaught of the pluvial wave.</p></div>

<p>Have we not here Academic verse well made
for the Umbrellas of the Academicians!</p>

<p>To come to extremes: among the popular songs,
we hear the song of <em class="e000I2">the Umbrella</em>, “a ditty found
in a whale”—</p>

<div class="poembox">
<p class="pi0">The good Umbrella may be sung</p>
<p class="pi1">In many airs and ways;</p>
<p class="pi0">The Umbrella, be we old or young,</p>
<p class="pi1">Will serve us all our days.</p>
<p class="pi0">It keeps true love from getting wet,</p>
<p class="pi1">And catching cold at night;</p>
<p class="pi0">It hides the thief, to business set,</p>
<p class="pi1">From the policeman’s sight.</p>
<p class="pi4">Umbrella!</p>
<p class="pi0">Then buy yourself, for fear of rain,</p>
<p class="pi0">A solid, useful, good, and plain</p>
<p class="pi4">Umbrella!</p>
<p class="pi0">In fact, for rain we cannot sell a</p>
<p class="pi0">Much better thing than our Umbrella!</p></div>

<p>This funny song is well worth the tiresome verse
sung at present—</p>

<div class="poembox">
<p class="pi0">He has not an Umbrella, well</p>
<p class="pi1">It is no matter, while it’s fine;</p>
<p class="pi0">But when the rain comes down pell-mell,</p>
<p class="pi1">Why, then he’s wetted to the spine! . . . .</p></div>

<p>Certainly one ought to write a physiological
monograph of these black mushrooms, which
to-day protect humanity, just as one ought to
rhyme a poem of the dainty Sunshade, that
pretty rosy cupola, which is one of the most
charming coquetries of a Frenchwoman.</p>

<p>We write this <em class="e000I2">one ought</em> with a vague sadness,
with the discouragement which makes us wish
for the future, what we should have been so
glad to bury in the past. In beginning our
work, we experienced a careless joy, we thought
the end was near on our very entry into the field,
and that we should quickly attain it, with the
satisfaction of having created a little work, both
complete and altogether graceful; but once on
our way, ferreting without relaxation in all the
literary thickets where some Parasol might lie
buried, in the fold of a phrase, in the middle
of a story, of an anecdote, or of a dissertation,
of some fact, we have gathered so ample a harvest,
our sheaf has become so large, so very large,
that it was impossible for us to bind our arms
about it, after having co-ordinated its various
parts. It is but a few poor strays then which
lie stranded here, the flotsam and jetsam of our hope,
sole vestiges of a project which, like all projects, became
Homeric as it grew great in the workshop of the imagination.</p>

<p>We end this essay, therefore, with a sentiment of ridicule,
in which we laugh at our own selves, that of having dreamed
of making a perfect monograph, and of having produced
nothing more than a little tumbled fantasy, which ironically
steals away out of sight, like that minuscular mouse, of
which the mountain was once upon a time delivered in
much moaning.</p>

<p>What matter! We must end. Let us hide our melancholy
retreat by humming this last lovely burden of a poet
of the school of Clairville—</p>

<div class="poembox">
<p class="pi0">’Tis called a <em class="e000I2">Pépin</em>,
a <em class="e000I2">Riflard</em>,</p>
<p class="pi0">And other viler names there are;</p>
<p class="pi0">Not one of all the Umbrella moves.</p>
<p class="pi0">Wisely it counts them no disgrace;</p>
<p class="pi0">Since—child of April’s art—the loves</p>
<p class="pi0">Oft make their quivers of its case!</p></div>

WELL, my dear friend, here I am, faithful
as you see to my appointment; I am
come deliberately to fulfil my promise,
which I so imprudently gave on a certain day last
season, upon a Breton strand, you remember, while
contemplating one of your rosy little hands, which
was whipping its sister with a long Swedish glove,
in a sort of angry pet, and gave to you an appearance
of wild and exquisite bluster?
</p>

<p>How did you manage, O Enchantress, to induce me to give my loyal
word that I would write for you the <em class="e000I2">History of
the Glove</em>? How! . . . who can ever say? When a pair of pretty
eyes envelop you, and bathe you with their radiance, when a smile
puts honey into your heart, and a tiny little hand is stretched out
with open palm, seeming to say, “Take me,” every kind of will melts
quickly away, consent mounts delightedly to the lips, and we promise
at once everything, before we know well what we are asked.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_080.jpg" width="600" height="607" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Ah, unhappy me! it is the Glove of Nessus
which you have placed upon my hand! The
History of the Glove! why, it is the history
of the world; and I should be very ill-advised
if I pretended <em class="e000I2">avoir les Gants</em> to be the first to
tell that history, as ancient as it is universal.</p>

<p>Haunted by this debt of honour, contracted to please
you, I went lately to see a learned old friend of mine, a
venerable Benedictine—better than a well of science; an
ocean of indulgence—to whom I exposed my foolish enterprise
of the Glove and the Mitten.</p>

<p>Ah, my friend, I only wish you could have seen him
all at once leap from his seat, look at me with compassion,
examine me profoundly with his eye, and murmur
three times in a tone of ineffable astonishment and sadness,
as though he believed me mad—</p>

<p>“The Glove!—the Glove!!—the Glove!!!—</p>

<p>“ . . . And so it is the Glove,” he went on, when he had
become a little calmer, “it is the history of this offensive
and defensive ornament, of this object so complex, of
which the origin is so obscure and so troublesome, it is
a monograph of the Glove that you desire to write! . . .
My dear child, allow me to believe that you have not
reflected on what you have engaged yourself to do, let me
think that you have brought more lightness than reason to
the conception of this enterprise. The Glove!—Why, with
the history of the Shoe, it is the most formidable work that
a learned man could dare to dream of executing. Look,”
he sighed, dragging forth a voluminous manuscript, “in the
<em class="e000I2">Bibliography of Words</em>, a colossal work, which I have commenced,
but, alas! shall never end, I see at the word
GLOVE more than fifteen hundred different works, Latin,
Greek, Italian, German, Spanish, English, and French,
which treat of this matter, and even this is but the rudest
sketch. We must consider the use of the Glove amongst
the ancient Hebrews, the Babylonians, the Armenians, the
Syrians, the Phœnicians, the Sidonians, the Parthians, the
Lydians, the Persians, the Greeks, the Romans, &#38;c.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_081.jpg" width="600" height="361" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“It would be necessary to divide the work into different Books,
subdivided into innumerable Chapters; thus for the etymology alone of
<em class="e000I2">the word Glove</em>, in the different dialects,
must be reserved a long notice of comparative philology; it would
be necessary to determine if the Glove which was used by the young
nude girls, who wrestled together in Lacedæmon, after Lycurgus had
installed there his Lyceums and public games—if this Glove, I say,
ought to be classed among the fighting mufflers or the leathern
gauntlets—and how many matters besides!” And my dear old friend
became still more and more excited, ever widening the question,
as if, it seemed to me, it were a case of establishing a complete
Encyclopedia. Diderot and d’Alembert would have grown pale before
that imperturbable science, which showed mountains of folios to be
cleared away, and unknown precipices to be sounded.</p>

<p>“But,” I hazarded in a little confusion, “I only think of writing
a light treatise, a thin volume of a few pages, one of those nothings
carried off by the wind, which pass for a second, like an anecdote
or tale, into a pretty feminine cerebellum; I wish to give hardly
a line to other countries than France, just to graze incidentally
the Glove of challenge, to speak only from memory of the pontifical
Gloves, to neglect the side of manufacture, the art of preparing
the skins, of removing the outside skin, and so on. I only desire
in one word to chat for a few instants, disconnectedly and in fits
and starts, on that portion of clothing which the ancients called
<em class="e000I2">Chirothecæ</em>, <em class="e000I2">Gannus</em>,
<em class="e000I2">Gantus</em>, <em class="e000I2">Guantus</em>, <em
class="e000I2">Wanto</em>, and <em class="e000I2">Wantus</em>, if I
may trust the <em class="e000I2">Glossary</em> of Du Cange.”</p>

<p>“Alas, that is true,” cried my old friend, in a
sadly modulated tone; “I am doting, eh? We, of
the old school, it is we who are the wet blankets,
the tedious savants. At the present day, when
journalism is to literature what the piano is to
music, an instrument upon which every one strums
without any conviction, is it not necessary to cut
matters short, and quickly create eternal <em class="e000I2">à peu
près</em> (pretty much the sames), little light dissertations,
notices made on the spur of the moment,
and superficial passion? We were in our time
egotists, fervent solitaries, unreadable and unread,
if you will; what does it matter? When a work
had fastened on our mind, we espoused it, after
a legitimate love, with all the joys of generation
and paternity. We wished to endow our
labour with all the qualities which it seemed able
to bear, to such an extent, that it became dry,
rugged, and severe. But how many were the delights
not to be forgotten, in those traces followed
for whole days, before our utterance of the joyous
<em class="e000I2">Eureka!</em>—how many inward intoxications in that
slow-brooding season, in that patient labour!—how
many minute investigations before resolving a historic
doubt! We were the exclusives of national
erudition, and thought one work sufficed for one
man, when he had fed it with his life, with his
watchings, with his very heart, with all the tenderness
of the creative workman.</p>

full of adventure, across the highways and secret paths of science.
I would commit the follies of Doctor Faustus, to return to the age

<p>The good old man,
kindled by his enthusiasm,
became transformed;
he seemed
desirous to take upon himself the whole history
of the Glove, which he embroidered at once
with fancy and the most varied anecdote that his
wonderful memory could supply. After having
distinguished, in the Middle Ages, many sorts
of Gloves, such as the <em class="e000I2">usual</em> Glove, the <em class="e000I2">falconer’s</em>
Glove, the <em class="e000I2">workman’s</em> Glove, the <em class="e000I2">feminine</em> Glove,
the <em class="e000I2">military</em> Glove, the <em class="e000I2">seignorial</em> Glove, and the
<em class="e000I2">liturgical</em> Glove, he attacked with a zest bordering
on frenzy the part of the Glove of the
knights and men in armour of the heroic
battles of the past, at a time when individual
prowess could still display itself; he quoted
the Chronicles of Du Guesclin and De Guigneville:—</p>

<div class="poembox">
<p class="pi00">“Rich basinets he ordered to be brought,</p>
<p class="pi0">And Gloves with iron spikes with horror fraught.”</p>
</div>

<p>He showed me, without recourse to aught but his own
erudition, the transformation of these iron gauntlets, first into
mail, like the coat, then into movable plates of flat iron,
adapted to the movements of the hand; he explained to me
the lining, where the palm was of leather or stuff, and at last,
exhuming the ordinances of 1311, he made me penetrate into
the details of the manufacture:—</p>

<p>“That no one should make Gloves of plates, except the
plates are tinned or varnished, or beaten, or covered with
black leather, red leather, or samite, and that under the
head of every nail should be set a rivet of gold.”</p>

<p>Ah, my fair friend, if you could have seen this
strange man so suddenly taken by my subject, you
would have regarded me with pity, for I could not
help pouting a little at this old dean, and felt myself
attacked by a sudden cowardice, at the mere announcement
of the formidable researches which
were to be undergone.</p>

<p>I took my humble leave of my most learned
master, humiliated, floored by the extent of his
knowledge, his laborious zeal, his powerful faith,
his stubborn will. I saw that in giving you my
word for a poor Glove, I had given it to a demon,
who showed me a Glove of an immense shagreen
skin, containing the world and its history—fantastic
as a nightmare, which weighed me down. Then I
swore to sacrifice a part for the rest, and not to build
a cathedral when a simple cushion at your feet
would suffice me for my heedless chatter. Accept
then favourably this act of contrition, and let me
be fully pardoned, if, <em class="e000I2">à propos</em> of the Glove, I bound
along madly like a young kid, without pity for the
history of costume and historic documents, which
I trample under my feet, rather than see myself
buried under their pyramidal bundles.</p>

<p>That which my old friend had probably neglected
is the Legend, and to that I run.</p>

<p>A charming poet and a charmer, Jean Godard,
a Parisian, the worthy rival of Ronsard, published
towards 1580 a piece entitled <em class="e000I2">The Glove</em>. This
witty nursling of the Muses pretends to show us
the origin of the Glove in the burning passion
which Venus cherished for Adonis. According to
our poet—</p>

<p class="pi00">“The young Adonis ever loved the field,</p>
<p class="pi0">Now hunting the swift stag with branching head,</p>
<p class="pi0">And now the tusked wild boar, just cause of dread.</p>
<p class="pi0">Venus, fierce burning with his love alway,</p>
<p class="pi0">Would never leave him neither night nor day,</p>
<p class="pi0">But running after his sweet eyes and face,</p>
<p class="pi0">Sought young Adonis, when he sought the chase:</p>
<p class="pi0">Deep into forests full of gloomy fear,</p>
<p class="pi0">The goddess followed him she held so dear.</p>
<p class="pi0">One day, as she pursued him, bursting through</p>
<p class="pi0">A bramble thicket, which by ill chance grew</p>
<p class="pi0">Athwart her path, a cruel, hardy thorn</p>
<p class="pi0">Pierced her white hand, and lo! the rose was born</p>
<p class="pi0">From her red blood. But Venus, vexed with pain,</p>
<p class="pi0">Lest any hurt should touch her hand again,</p>
<p class="pi0">Bade all at once her unclad Graces sew</p>
<p class="pi0">A leathern shelter for her hand of snow.</p>
<p class="pi0">The lovely Graces, draped in floating hair,</p>
<p class="pi0">No longer left their own hands free and bare,</p>
<p class="pi0">But bound and covered them as Venus did.</p>
<p class="pi0">And now the Glove’s true origin is hid</p>
<p class="pi0">No longer. This is it. Fair girls alone</p>
<p class="pi0">Wore on their hands what now is common grown.</p>
<p class="pi0">Then came the Emperor, and then his court,</p>
<p class="pi0">And then at last the folk of every sort.”</p>
</div>

<p>Charming in its <em class="e000I2">naïveté</em>, is it not, my
dear friend, this fable which gives the Glove the same origin as the
rose!</p>

<p>The use of Gloves was widely spread in the
Middle Ages. They covered the wrist entirely,
even with women. “The Gloves of the common
people,” says M. Charles Louandre, “were of sheep-skin,
of doe skin, or of fur; those of bishops were made in
chain-stitch of silk with gold thread; those of simple
priests were of black leather.” But what will surprise you
is that, contrary to the present custom, it was absolutely
forbidden to appear gloved before great personages.</p>

<p>In a manuscript lately published, <em class="e000I2">The Sayings of the
Merchants</em>, a merchant cries, with an engaging air—</p>

<div class="poembox">
<p class="pi00">“I have pretty little bands,</p>
<p class="pi1">&#160;&#160;And for damsels dainty Gloves,</p>
<p class="pi0">Furred to warm their snowy hands,</p>
<p class="pi1">&#160;&#160;These I sell to those sweet loves.”</p>
</div>

<p>But what were the furred Gloves of sweet loves or gentle
ladies compared to those which the fair Venetians showed
on the grand days of ceremonies, when the Doge prepared
to mount the Bucentaur for the purpose of espousing the
sea? These, according to M. Feuillet de Conches, were
Gloves of silk marvellously embroidered, embossed with
gold and pearls; some of them were of lace of an incomparable
richness, well worthy to be offered as a present,
and to figure in the budget of handsome acknowledgments.
But the most wonderful were the Gloves of
painted skin, like the water-colours on
Fans.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 358px;">
<img src="images/i_089a.jpg" width="358" height="348" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Here were country scenes, sheepfolds,
pictures of ravishing gallantry, miniatures
beyond price. “And even,”
observes M. Feuillet de Conches,
“the heels of the shoes of
dandies were decorated by
Watteau or by Parrocel.”</p>

<p>The Valois doted, you know,
on perfumed Gloves; this taste was fatal
to Jeanne d’Albret, who found her death in
trying a pair of Gloves dexterously prepared by
some Italian quack, a friend of the sombre Catherine.
Consider, my friend, that with my romantic
instinct, and my temperament full of love for the
drama, I might find here an easy transition, and tell you,
in long excited phrases, of the exploits of the Marchioness of
Brinvilliers, and the grim Gaudin de Sainte-Croix; show you
these sinister poisoners preparing by night their infamous
Glove stock; then in a tale fantastic as the <em class="e000I2">Olivier Brusson</em>
of Hoffmann, evoke the famous trial of the Marchioness, the
torture, the various punishments, the burning chamber, up to
the final stake. All this <em class="e000I2">à propos</em> of the Glove—who can say
if such simple history would not be worth more than all the
cock-and-bull stories which I am about to tell you, by compulsion,
concerning the Glove and the Mittens? In very
truth, I would prefer, as your <em class="e000I2">vis-à-vis</em>, to show myself a
romancist, not an historian, for I should be sure of being
less of a bore, more personal, and, above all—shall I avow
it?—not in any degree common-place. But, as Miguel de
Cervantes said, “Our desires are extremely seditious servants.”
I will be then reactionary, and will close the door against these
socialists of sentiment.</p>

<p>All this fine rigmarole
has made me think of presenting
you with a letter
of Antonio Perez to Lady
Rich, sister of Lord Essex,
who had asked him for
some dogskin Gloves:—</p>

<p>“I have experienced,” he writes, “so much
affliction in not having by me the dogskin Gloves
desired by your ladyship, that, waiting their arrival,
I have resolved to flay a little skin on the most
delicate part of my own body—if, indeed, any
delicate part can be found upon my rude self.
Love and devotion to a lady’s service may surely
make a man flay himself for her, and cut her a
pair of Gloves out of his own skin. But how can I
pride myself on this with your ladyship, when it is
my custom to flay even my very soul for those I
love? Could mine be seen as clearly as my body,
it would appear full of tatters, the most lamentable
sort of soul in the world;—the Gloves are of dog’s
skin, madam, and yet of my own, for I hold myself
as a dog, and supplicate your ladyship to hold me
in like regard, in requital of my faith and my passion
in your service.”</p>

<p>What think you of this out-and-out gallant, of
this “dying” passionate lover? Here it seems to
me, <em class="e000I2">à propos</em> of scented Gloves, we have a Castilian
gentleman exceedingly well skilled in the delicate
art of offering them to ladies.</p>

<p>Spanish Gloves are reproached with too strong a
smell; the French ladies suffer strangely from their
too heady odour: Antonio Perez would certainly have
been an excellent manufacturer of perfumed Gloves—discreet
in his scents, distinguished in his form.</p>

<p>The Gloves most in vogue after the time of La Fronde were the
Gloves of Rome, of Grenoble, of Blois, of Esla, and of Paris. M.
de Chanteloup charged Poussin to buy him Roman Gloves, and the
latter wrote back on 7th October, 1646: “Here are a dozen pairs
of Gloves, half men’s, half women’s. They cost half-a-pistole a
pair, which makes eighteen crowns for the whole.” The 18th October,
1649, another purchase; but this time they are Gloves scented with
Frangipane, with which Poussin provided himself for M. de Chanteloup;
and these he bought at la Signora Maddelena’s, “a woman famous
for her perfumes.” In Paris, according to <em class="e000I2">The
Convenient Address Book</em> of Nicolas de Blegny—the Bottin of
1692—there were a certain number of manufacturers of perfumed Gloves
in the Rue de l’Arbre-Sec and the Rue Saint-Honoré. “There are,”
says the editor of this commercial almanac, “Glove-merchants very
well stocked; for instance, M. Remy, opposite Saint-Méderic, who
is famous for his excellent buck-skin Gloves; Arsan, hard by the
Abbey Saint-Germain; Richard, Rue Saint-Denis, <em class="e000I2">at
the little St. John</em>, well known for his Gloves of <em
class="e000I2">Fowl-skin</em>; and Richard, Rue Galande, at <em
class="e000I2">the Great King</em>, whose commerce is in doeskin
Gloves.”</p>

<p>The name of fowl-skin Glove doubtless astonishes
you—another name was outer lamb skin; they were
made for the use of ladies during the summer. The pretended
fowl-skin was nothing but the epidermis of kid-skin, and the
preparation of this epidermis was the real triumph of the Glove-merchants
of Paris and Rome. Gloves of <em class="e000I2">Canepin</em>, or outer
lamb’s-skin, were made, it is said, so delicate and thin, that
a pair of them could be easily enclosed in a walnut shell.</p>

<p>The buck-skin or buffalo-skin Glove was specially made for
falconers; it covered the right hand half up the arm, thus completely
protecting it against the claws, or rather the talons, of
the bird, falcon, gerfalcon, or sparrow-hawk, when it came to
settle on their fist.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

</div>

<p>Hawking existed even under Louis XIII., but it was no
longer the grand and splendid epoch of this aristocratic sport,
so profoundly interesting. In one of his ancient legends,
André le Chapelain, of whom Stendhal wrote a short biographical
notice, speaks of a sparrow-hawk,
to gain which the magic Glove was necessary.
This Glove could only be obtained
by a victory in the lists
over two of the most formidable
champions of Christendom. It
was suspended to a golden
column, and very carefully
guarded. But when
the knight had by his
skill gained the Glove, he
saw the beautiful sparrow-hawk
so much desired swoop down immediately upon his
fist.</p>

<p>Up to the age of Louis XIV., the skin Glove was destined
rather for the use of men, and it was only under this Prince
that Gloves mounting a long way up the arm, and long Mittens
of silk netting to set off the hands of women, were generally
adopted by them.</p>

<p>Gloves <em class="e000I2">à l’occasion</em>, <em class="e000I2">à la Cadenet</em>, <em class="e000I2">à la Phyllis</em>, <em class="e000I2">à la Frangipane</em>,
<em class="e000I2">à la Néroli</em>, Gloves <em class="e000I2">of the last cut</em> worn awhile by the <em class="e000I2">Précieuses</em>,
ceased to be fashionable about 1680. The custom, of which
Tallemant speaks, of presenting ladies, after the banquet, with
basins of Spanish Gloves, was only vulgarised in passing from
the Court to the town.</p>

<p>Dangeau, in his <em class="e000I2">Memoirs</em>, has written a chapter on the <em class="e000I2">Etiquette
of Gloves and the Ceremonial of Mittens</em>. I refer you to it without
ceremony.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<p>Under Louis XV., in the eighteenth century, so full
of the rustle of silk, so enchanting that I fear
to stop on it in your company, lest I should
never leave it, the wearing of Gloves quickly
became an enormous luxury. All those
fair coquettes, whom
you have seen at
their toilets, or
their <em class="e000I2">petit lever</em>,
after Nattier,
Pater, or
Moreau,
surrounded by their “<em class="e000I2">filles de modes</em>,” caused a
greater massacre of Gloves at the time of trying
them on, than our richest worldlings of to-day.
These Gloves were of kid, of thread, and of silk;
the most celebrated came from Vendôme, from
Blois, from Grenoble, and from Paris; they were
generally made of white skin, wretchedly sewn,
but the cut was extremely graceful, with its cuff
falling from the wrist over the hand, and small
ribbons and fine rosettes of carnation interlaced
on this cuff.</p>

<p>Gloves sewn after the English fashion were
highly appreciated. It became a proverb, that
for a Glove to be good, three realms must have
contributed to it: “Spain to prepare the skin and
make it supple, France to cut it, and England
to sew it.”</p>

<p>Caraccioli maintains that a woman of fashion, about the
middle of the eighteenth century, would not dispense with
changing her Gloves four or five times a day. “The <em
class="e000I2">petits-maîtres</em>,” he adds, “never fail to put on,
in the morning, Gloves of rose or <em class="e000I2">jonquil</em>,
perfumed by the celebrated Dulac.” As to Mittens, the same observer
of the century notices them as specially belonging to women.
“Nevertheless,” he says, “in winter the manufacturers make furred
Mittens, and men now wear them when they travel.”</p>

<p>Madame de Genlis has this curious observation
in her <em class="e000I2">Dictionary of Etiquette</em>: “If you have anything
to present to a princess, and have your Glove
on, you must needs take it off.”</p>

<p>How many anecdotes, how many literary souvenirs,
the Glove of the eighteenth century summons
to the thought!</p>

<p>You remember, I am quite sure, that pretty
chapter consecrated by Sterne, in his <em class="e000I2">Sentimental
Journey</em>, to the beautiful Grisette who sold Gloves,
into whose shop he entered to ask his way. The
pretty Glove-seller coquets with the stranger, shows
herself extremely complaisant, and the sentimental
traveller, to prove his gratitude for her kindness,
asks for some Gloves, and tries on several pairs
without finding one to suit him. But he takes
two or three pairs all the same before he goes.</p>

<p>The story leaves a fresh feature in the mind:
an English artist has fixed it with much delicacy
on a remarkable canvas, which figures in the
National Gallery. The authors of the <em class="e000I2">Vie Parisienne</em>
were surely inspired by it a little later in their
joyous libretto, when they wrote the well-known
couplets of the lady who sold Gloves and the
Brazilian.</p>

<p>Permit me also to relate to you an anecdote,
rather slight in texture, of which Duclos is the hero,
and which has all the flavour of his roguish age:—</p>

<p>The author of <em class="e000I2">Manners</em> was bathing on the
flowery borders of the Seine, and giving himself
up to skilled <em class="e000I2">hand-over-hand</em>, when he suddenly
heard piercing cries of distress. He rushes out
of the water, runs up
the bank without taking time
to slip on his “indispensables,”
and finds a young and charming woman,
whose carriage had just been overturned in
a rut. He hastens to beauty in tears, lying on
the ground, and making a gracious bow, in
his academic nudity, “Madam,” says he, in
offering her his hand to assist her to rise,
“pardon my want of Gloves.”</p>

<p>Here we have at once the expression of a scoffing sceptic,
and a giddy philosopher, full of a particular charm. Do not
believe, my gentle friend, that if I remain in your company
so short a time in the beginning of the eighteenth century—the
only one which has, you cannot deny it, all its perfumed
quintessence—do not believe that I intend to linger
in the Revolution, and conduct you to the house of Mademoiselle
Lange, Madame Talien, Madame Récamier, and all
the fashionable drawing-rooms of the First Republic, the Directory,
the Consulate, and the Empire; to take ceremoniously
the hand of the marvellous Beauties, the Nymphs, and Muses
of those troubled times, in order the better to show you what
extravagant Gloves, what prodigious Mittens, were then worn.
The <em class="e000I2">Ladies’ Journal</em>, and all the small journals of fashion,
will surely teach you more about the Gloves worn by these
worldly Calypsos and Eucharises than six hundred monotonous
pages of varied descriptions. There is no Museum, however,
preserving the objects of art which the Revolution marked
deeply with its seal; and this fact will make me insist on a
model of a special Glove, destined for a representative of
the people despatched to the army, of which an erudite
archæologist of the Revolution, and at the same time a remarkable
humourist, Champfleury, has been good enough
to communicate to me a design. This Glove of doe-skin,
manufactured according to order, and broidered with arabesques
about the slopings of the thumb, bears on the back
of the hand a vignette in the form of a seal, which represents
Liberty holding in her hand the pike, the Phrygian
cap, and the scales of justice—a Liberty, you will say, by
no means at liberty . . . . in her movements:—on the right
is crouched a lion, the sign of force; on the left a cat, a
sign of independence.</p>

<p>I will not lose my time in paraphrasing for you this
symbolic vignette; and, with a long historic stride, I will
conduct you into the quietude of some chateau, under
the Restoration, and, in the evening twilight, to the terrace
before a great park. I will there show you two lovers
warbling a serenade—the timid young girl touching a
guitar, the young man deeply moved, putting a world
of passion into his baritone voice. On the hands
of the singer, behold, pearly grey gloves fastening
with a single button; on the dainty little fingers
supporting the guitar, examine those Mittens of
black silk lace, open worked, like those which,
according to tradition, are worn by the heroine
of that charming comedy, the <em class="e000I2">Marriageable Maid</em>.</p>

<p>There rises on my lips
a song of the time which
the <em class="e000I2">Almanac of the Muses</em> has bequeathed us, to
the air of <em class="e000I2">The Little Sailor</em>. It will perhaps add
a spice of interest to my story. “Now, listen,
my friend,” as they used to say in the noble ages
of chivalry. Title of the song: <em class="e000I2">The Gloves</em>.</p>

<div class="poembox">
<p class="pi0">I love the Glove, that covers quite</p>

<p>The song is not so bad, truly; and if the Muse
gloves the author a little tightly, the tone of his
strophes is none the less strictly respectable and
proper.</p>

<p>Under Louis XVIII. and Charles X. long Gloves
were very costly; still, no coquette hesitated to
change them every day, for it was necessary for
them to be of extreme freshness of colour, which
was either buff, gridelin, or white. Some years
later, the fashion tended to maize, straw, or nut
colour for the evening and morning toilet, and
to palisander, burnt bread, cedar, fawn, for afternoon
visits. Yellow Gloves had an infinite scale
of tones, from a soft and delicate unbleached lawn
colour to the glaring yellow of a stage-coach. White
doe-skin was only used by men when riding.</p>

<p>It was about this epoch, if I mistake not, that
the denunciation of <em class="e000I2">Gant jaune</em> (yellow glove)
became synonymous with <em class="e000I2">petit-maître</em> (dandy).
In London, the disciples of Brummel—of the
most refined elegance—constituted a society, and
formed the Club of the <em class="e000I2">Fringed Glove</em>. This
club no longer existed doubtless in 1839, when
d’Orsay established thus despotically the rules of
the perfect gentleman:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_100.jpg" width="600" height="428" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“An English gentleman of fashion,” said he, “ought to
use six pair of Gloves a day:</p>

<p>“In the morning to drive a britzska to the hunt: Gloves
of reindeer.</p>

<p>“At the hunt, to follow a fox: Gloves of shammy
leather.</p>

<p>“To return to London in a Tilbury, after a drive at
Richmond in the morning: Gloves of beaver.</p>

<p>“To go later for a walk in Hyde Park, or to conduct
a lady to pay her visits or make her purchases in London,
and <em class="e000I2">to offer her your hand in descending from the carriage</em>:
coloured kid Gloves braided.</p>

<p>“To go to a dinner-party: yellow dog’s skin Gloves—and
in the evening for a ball or rout: Gloves of white lamb-skin
embroidered with silk.”</p>

<p>What odious tyranny is so exacting a fashion! And how
sensible was Balzac when he wrote: “Dandyism is a heresy
of fashion; in making himself a dandy, a man becomes a
piece of furniture of the boudoir, an extremely ingenious
puppet, which can pose on a horse, or on a sofa, which
sucks habitually the end of a walking-stick, but a reasonable
being—never!”</p>

<p>It is, however, with some dandy of the school of Rubempré
and Rastignac, that often, on quitting the ball, an
author shows us a romantic young lady in love, whose
jealousy gnaws at her heart, who re-reads the letters of old
times, and with wandering looks, like one overwhelmed,
nervously tearing with her teeth a finger of her Glove,
sadly dreams that the lover who is no longer all, is nothing,
and that the moralist much deceived himself who wrote:
“Woman is a charming creature, who puts off her love
as easily as her Glove.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 599px;">
<img src="images/i_101.jpg" width="599" height="356" alt="" />
</div>

<p>How many things are there, look you, in a Glove!</p>

<p>In the novel <em class="e000I2">The Lion in Love</em> of Frédéric Soulié, Léonce
signs the register of marriages at the mayoralty with a gloved
hand; and when Lise’s turn comes, the young girl stops,
saying in a voice tinged with just a touch of mockery,
“Pardon me, let me remove my Glove.”</p>

<p>“Léonce understood,” then says the author, “that he
had signed with his gloved hand.” Sign an act of marriage
with a Glove! Léonce meditated a little, and said to himself:
“These people have certain delicacies. What difference
makes a Glove more or less to the holiness of an
oath, or the signature of a document? Nothing assuredly;
and yet it seems that there is more sincerity in a naked
hand, which affixes the signature of a man in testimony of
the truth. It is one of those imperceptible sentiments of
which we are unable to give an exact account, but which
nevertheless exist.”</p>

<p>The fact is, that the Glove is not really, as has been
said, a tyrant of which the hand is the slave, but quite
the contrary—it is the hand’s servant; and with the hand,
as Montaigne wrote, “We request, promise, call, dismiss,
menace, pray, supplicate, deny, refuse, interrogate,
admire, number, confess, repent, fear, shame,
double, instruct, command, incite, encourage,
swear, witness, accuse, condemn, absolve, injure,
contemn, distrust, track, flatter, applaud, bless,
humiliate, mock, reconcile, recommend, exalt,
feast, rejoice, complain, sadden, discomfort, despair,
astonish, write, suppress,” &#38;c.</p>

<p>I stop out of breath: verbs of every kind may
pass into the list.</p>

<p>With the Egyptians, the hand was a symbol of
force; with the Romans, a symbol of fidelity.
We please ourselves in clothing the occult powers,
such as Time, Nature, Destiny, with a human hand:
the hand of Time overthrows empires, and impresses
wrinkles on our brows; the hand of
Nature is prodigal to us of gifts, which are
ravished from us by the hand of Death; the
hand of Destiny or of Providence, in fine, conducts
us across the paths of life.</p>

<p>Old stereotyped language, which we use, and
shall use always. Are we not, as Saint Evremond
said, in the hands of love, as the balls in the
hands of tennis-players—and the first happiness
which love can give, is it not, according to Stendhal—and
all the truly sensitive—the first pressure
of the hand of the woman we love?</p>

<p>Our ancestors swore by the hand, and read in
the hand the mysteries of the future. On the
day of coronation, the hand of justice was borne
before the kings; the hand is used in salutation;
we ask for the <em class="e000I2">hand</em> of the lady we wish to
espouse in lawful marriage; we wash our hands,
like Pontius Pilate, of faults which we could not
help committing; and if I were to have to make
for you the panegyric of this organ, I should
have, like Scheherazade, to put off the end of
my discourse every day till the morrow. Sir
Charles Bell, in his book, <em class="e000I2">The Hand: Its Mechanism,
etc.</em>, has given a synthesis of all I could
possibly add, and has proved that the human
hand is so admirably formed, possesses a sensibility
so exquisite, that sensibility governs with so
much precision all its movements, it answers so
instantaneously to the impulses of the will, that
one might be tempted to believe that it is itself
its seat. All its actions are so energetic, so free,
and withal so delicate, that it appears to have
an instinct apart; and neither its complication
as an instrument is ever dreamt of, nor the
relations which subject it to the mind. We avail
ourselves of the service of the hand, as we perform
the act of respiration, without thinking of
it; and we have lost all remembrance of its first
feeble efforts, as of the slow exercise which has
brought it to perfection.</p>

<p>The hand, in a word, is the most perfect instrument
given by God to man; but I ought not to forget, my fair
friend, that poets seldom wear gloves, and philosophers
never; and that, philosophising as I am, I remain outside
the Glove, and, above all, appear to forget that axiom of
Fontenelle: Had we our hand full of authenticated facts
or truths, we should but half open it, and that after a
feeble fashion.</p>

<p>The Glove is worthy of entering into the legend of a
fairy tale, and remaining there always, as the slipper has
entered into the poetry even of fable, with the theme of
<em class="e000I2">Cinderella</em>. An ancient King of France was indeed in
love all his life with an unknown woman, only from
having seen her Glove in the midst of a masked
ball given to his court. Could it not easily be
conceived according to the approximative aphorism,
“Show me your Glove, I will tell you who
you are.” At the opera ball, in the surge of
masks and of dominoes, in the midst of the
comings and goings on that staircase so exalted,
it needs but a Glove imprisoning a little hand
to allure at once the passion of a man of
delicacy—a long white Glove lovingly glued
to a hand divinely small, a fine delicate
wrist, and the exquisite roundness of the
forearm. This is enough to transport
a lover of the fair sex.
The Glove appears not only in all festivals
where grace and beauty preside; it is
found in all the rudeness and clumsiness
of its origin at the Poles, among the Norwegians,
the Laps, and the Fins, who wear
huge Gloves of wool in summer, and thick
Gloves of reindeer skin, with the hair
outside, in winter.</p>

<p>Defended by these Gloves, they sometimes
sally bravely from their huts, in spite
of the cruel frosts, to kill the white bear
and the seal, just as the dramatic engravings
which illustrate our stories of voyages to the
North Pole represent them to us.</p>

<p>But methinks your eye is asking me in disquietude
about two little bound books which I have in my reach.
Reassure yourself, these are not recitals of tourists, which
are for painting us the manners of the inhabitants of
Karasjok or of the Lofoten Isles: I will read to you at
once, without allowing you to languish any longer, their
titles. Upon one of these works, see for yourself <em class="e000I2">Collection
of the Best Riddles of the Time</em>, composed on divers serious
and sprightly subjects by Colletet; on the other, <em class="e000I2">Collection
of Riddles of the Time</em>, by the Abbé Cotin. You already
divine that I intend to act no traitor’s part towards you,
and that I am going to read you some old charades in
verse upon Gloves:</p>

<p>The first riddle—<em class="e000I2">énigme</em> has been masculine in French
at least since the seventeenth century, in despite of its
profound femininity—the first riddle, in obscure
and ambiguous terms, indicates that the Glove,
after having been the natural covering of a rustic
animal, serves to-day as an artificial covering for
an animal more refined: man!</p>

<div class="poembox">
<p class="pi0">We’re two or ten, and to a body wed,</p>
<p class="pi1">We once a thing of breathing life were over;</p>
<p class="pi0">Like it we lived, and now, although we’re dead,</p>
<p class="pi1">Another life more excellent we cover.</p></div>

<p>This quatrain riddle is by François Colletet, that poor poet up to
his neck in mud. Listen now to Cotin—the Trissotin of Molière—in
this singular sextain:—</p>

<div class="poembox">
<p class="pi0">With mortal flesh our five soft mouths we fill,</p>
<p class="pi0">And in the winter to repletion feed;</p>
<p class="pi0">If one of us be lost, the world’s agreed</p>
<p class="pi0">To treat the rest of us exceeding ill;</p>
<p class="pi0">But if we all remain together, then</p>
<p class="pi0">We do almost all that is done by men.</p></div>

<p>Mediocre, isn’t it; tortured, bombastic, gross, all
at once? There is nothing here to make us fall
into an ecstasy, and repeat to satiety, as some
highly refined courtiers used to do, “Ah, with what
congruity of terms are these thoughts expressed!”</p>

<p>I shall abandon the riddles at once. These
two specimens are enough. Another point:</p>

<p>Many physiologists affirm that great warriors
have been remarkable for a beautiful hand, which
they loved perhaps to adorn with the most delicate
gloves. They instance Cyrus, Alexander, Cæsar,
Charlemagne, and Napoleon.</p>

<p>According to an historian of the First Empire,
some generals attending Bonaparte one day in
his private room, found his big military Gloves
and his little hat on a side-table. Actuated by
curiosity, each one of them tried in turn the
Glove and the hat; but it appears there was not
a single hand which could force its entrance into
those big Gloves, and upon those giants’ shoulders
not a single head which could fill up the little hat.</p>

<p>Napoleon was, it is weil known, no less proud
of his hand than Byron, who, his biographer tells
us, had a hand so small, that it was out of all proportion
with his face. Byron thought and wrote
that nothing characterised birth more than the
hand; it was, according to him, almost the sole
index of aristocracy of blood.</p>

<p>Since the fifteenth century, we can trace in the
museums of France, Holland, Italy, Spain, and
Germany, the interest which painters of all schools
have taken in the study of the hand, and, indeed,
of the Glove. Van Dyck and Rubens were passed
masters in this art, and Titian has left an admirable
masterpiece in his <em class="e000I2">Young Man with the Glove</em>.
Velasquez almost always makes his powerful
models hold Gloves, nobly folded in their right
hand. In Venetian paintings we see the Glove
on the hands of the Doge, of his wife, of ambassadors,
of senators, of residents, and even of
merchants. The mere study of the Gloves in
these portraits and these costumes would suffice
for a long pamphlet, for we must consider the
Glove in all classes of society and in all epochs,
from the embroidered Gloves of the Doges to the special
Gloves of the merchants, of the rectors of the university
of Padua, and even of the monks of the
brotherhood of the Cross, which were violet
on a white ground, &#38;c.</p>

<p>But it would be madness to endeavour to
omit nothing in this monograph of the Glove,
a tentative work, and an unpremeditated sketch
of little pretension.</p>

<p>Have we not still to consider the stuffed
fencing Glove, with the short shield of red
leather, and the giant Glove which swells the
fist of the boxers?—the ordinance Glove of the good
Dumanet; that white cotton Glove which the brave trooper
puts on so willingly on Sunday, coming out of barracks like
a conquering hero? Is there not besides the Glove of the
Cuirassier, with its large shield of buckskin, which this last
man of iron places so gallantly on his hip when he is on
express service?</p>

<p>The history of Gauntlets and of military Gloves from the time
of the Middle Ages would make a mighty volume, like the ladies’
Glove and the work-people’s Mitten. The liturgical Glove, yet more
important, is of three kinds: the <em class="e000I2">pontifical

I should not have set on the table aught beyond that which lends

hat, roses and a love-letter half opened; such simple still life had
assuredly better inspired my Muse than all the documents brought

<p>“The learned man, or the elegant man of the world,
who would search out in every epoch the costumes of a
people, would compile the most interesting history and the
most rationally true. . . . . To ask the origin of shoes, of
alms-purses, of hoods, of the cockade, of hoop-petticoats,
of farthingales, of <em class="e000I2">Gloves</em>, of masks, is to drag a <em class="e000I2">modilogist</em>
into the frightful maze of sumptuary laws, and upon all the
battlefields, where civilisation has triumphed over the gross
manners imported into Europe by the barbarism of the
Middle Ages.</p>

<p>“Things futile in appearance,” continues the author of the <em
class="e000I2">Théorie de la démarche</em>, “represent either ideas
or interests—whether it be bust, or foot, or head”—he might have
said, above all, or hand—“you will ever see a social progress, a
retrograde system, or some desperate struggle formulating itself
by the assistance of some part or other of the dress. Now the shoe
announces a privilege, now the hat signals a revolution—a piece
of embroidery, a scarf, or some ornament of straw, is the sign of
a party. Why should the toilet be then always the most eloquent
of styles, if it was not really the whole man, the man with his
political opinions, the man with the text of his existence, the
hieroglyphic man? To-day <em class="e000I2">Vestignomy</em> has
become almost a branch of the art created by Gall and Lavater.”</p>

<p>I am overwhelmed, O my indulgent friend! I
feel that I have been far inferior to my task, and
I fear I have not had that charming art of saying
nothing which often says so many things. I have
neglected to show you the Glove in princely <em class="e000I2">Inventaires</em>,
in the old chronicles, and in the delightful
tales of Boccaccio, of the Queen of Navarre, of
Straparole, of Bonaventure Desperriers, and even
in Brantôme, who has written a little story, full of
old French <em class="e000I2">esprit</em>, on a Glove found in the bed of
a fashionable lady. I had a good opportunity of
showing you the anecdotic Glove of ever so many
romances and memoirs from <em class="e000I2">Le Petit Jehan de
Saintre</em> up to Casanova the Venetian, going
through <em class="e000I2">l’ Histoire amoureuse des Gaules</em>.</p>

<p>But the natural and the unpremeditated is
also a French quality, of which we must sometimes
allow the grace, even in recognising its
defects. I left the history of the Glove, I believe,
in 1840; and I do not suppose that I have
painted for you all the little cuffs, festoons, ruches,
notchings, indentations, which adorned the fastenings
of the town Gloves of our elegant ladies, nor
the long black mittens which accompanied the
blonde bodices, of which in those modest times
people were madly fond. It is of little consequence
for me to follow the fashions from 1840 to the
present day: one cannot be a woman and remain
ignorant of these different variations of a fashion
of which all the specimens return periodically to
reconquer a second of celebrity. Open-worked
Gloves of Chinese silk, Spanish Gloves, Beaver
Gloves, Swedish Gloves, glacé kid Gloves, musketeers’
Gloves, Colombine, with cuffs—what do
I say?—the qualifications are innumerable; they
change still more than the fashion, for the epithet
gives a springtide and deceives the customer—<em class="e000I2">a
fortiori</em> would it deceive the <em class="e000I2">Gantuographer</em>, if
you will allow me this hideous neologism.</p>

<p>That which I have not been able to accomplish,
that which you have not demanded of me, that
which nevertheless would have interested you far
more than this sleepy talk, is the <em class="e000I2">Physiology of the
Glove</em>, with this epigraph taken from an anonymous
but witty author—“The style is the man; the
Glove is the woman; the style sometimes deceives,
but the Glove never.”</p>

<p>I am launched, don’t you see, into theories historic,
philosophic, and, above all, physiognomic, in a study altogether
beside the mark?</p>

<p>Allow, my sweet and somnolent one, that if you had
permitted me at first to take this part (which for my slight
notice was assuredly better), I should have been less
clumsily stiff, less dull above all, less pretentious besides;
albeit I make no other pretension here than to do your
pleasure. You have thrown me the Glove on the confines
of history; it is thence that I have raised it with more
effeminancy than swagger.</p>

<p>I could have wished that fancy might have dictated to
history; but, in the present case, it is the most that has
been done, if history has succeeded in warming the amiable
fancy, which has not taken Gloves to make us villainously
sulky with each other.</p>

<p>Pardon!—indulgent interlocutress!</p>

<p>Excuse also, amiable lady readers, ye who read this congealed
babble, and who have yet less reason to be favourable
to me, in this sense, that to you all, alas! I cannot say,
as was once said in the polite world—<em class="e000I2">Friendship allows the
Glove.</em></p>

THE Muff! The very name has something
about it delicate, downy, and voluptuous. From that little warm
satin nest, where pretty chilly little hands ensconce themselves
in silk, carrying with them a lace handkerchief, a box of
lozenges, a bouquet of Parma violets, or a tender loving <em
class="e000I2">billet-doux</em>, a thousand trifles spring up to
please us, like a swarm of souvenirs and caressing thoughts of our

pass our hands over it the wrong way to excite the electricity of
the long hair, to plunge our faces in the pungent heady odour of its
down, and to make use of this furred sack in inconceivable tricks, in
playing at hide-and-seek with small objects, or in burying therein
the familiar cat, who becomes lazy in its warmth.</p>

<p>Then, later on, at the hour of the first rendezvous, during one
of those icy winters which Ronsard dreaded for his darling, when we
see our so much desired mistress appear veiled and all imprisoned in
furs, we become almost jealous of the pretty and coquettish Muff, in
which she buries her roguish little nose, which the glacial breeze
has lashed and reddened, and we plunge then with a sweet brutality
our own hands into the silky cylinder, there to find, and there
passionately to press the pretty idle fingers, which we are for so
generously thawing, by covering them with long kisses like gloves.</p>

petticoat, or in passing along radiant in a long furry pelisse, or
more passive in letting herself glide languishingly in a sledge

her side, and pushes forward her coquettish equipage. It seems that

<p>The more she hides, muffles up, deadens, so to speak, her beauty,
the more woman—a creature of Hades who makes us dream of paradise—is
bewitching in the diabolicity of her graces. When Love, who is
represented blind, sets a mask on Venus-coquette, one might think the
trickster boy was for burning the universe, for behind those yawning
apertures of the black velvet mask, behind those murderous loopholes,
two woman’s eyes are lying in ambush, pitiless, turn by turn
laughing, burning, blazing, drowned in pleasure, charged, in a word,
as with grape-shot, with all the shafts of the Cupidonian quiver.</p>

<p>The ancients had perhaps great reason to attach, as they did,
certain excellences and prerogatives to fur: a master furrier,
Charrier, wrote on this subject, in 1634, remarks and moral
considerations as naïve as curious: “Our kings, whether they are
consecrated, crowned, or married, divest themselves of the splendour
of embroideries and of diamonds, to take their royal mantle hedged

<p>The ancients had perhaps great reason to attach, as they did,
certain excellences and prerogatives to fur: a master furrier,
Charrier, wrote on this subject, in 1634, remarks and moral
considerations as naïve as curious: “Our kings, whether they are
consecrated, crowned, or married, divest themselves of the splendour
of embroideries and of diamonds, to take their royal mantle hedged
about with lilies and lined with ermine.</p></div>
<!--**********-->

<p>“The mantles of the chevaliers, dukes, and peers
of France are lined with lynx, marten, and ermine;
the chancellors, keepers of the seals, who are the
guardians of our laws, wear the most exquisite furs.</p>

<p>“Bachelors and doctors, emperors and physicians
clothe themselves with furs which represent the
mysteries of theology, the maxims of politics, the
secrets of medicine. Furs cure people of headaches
and disordered stomachs; attacks of gout
which triumph over the most potent remedies, are
vanquished by the skins of cats, lambs, and hares.”</p>

<p>In fine, the good Charrier proves with pride that
of all the ornaments which luxury has invented
there is none so glorious, so august, so precious, as
furs, and that the privileges of peltry merchants
rightly surpass those of all others.</p>

<p>The masters and wardens of the peltry merchandise
had for their arms a paschal lamb on an
azure field. Two ermines supported the shield
crested with the ducal crown, with this device in
exergue—very like that of Brittany—<em class="e000I2">Malo mori
quam fœdari</em>.</p>

<p>The use of furs dates back to the origin of the
world. Plutarch, in his <em class="e000I2">Table Talk</em>, relates that
people dressed themselves in skins before they became
acquainted with stuffs. Tacitus assures us it
was the same with the Teutons, Propertius with the
Romans.</p>

<div class="poembox">
<p class="pi0">Robed in rich silk, the Court you now behold</p>
<p class="pi0">Was once a folk fur-clad against the cold,</p>
</div>

<p class="continue">says a poet of the sixteenth century. But without
stopping at the conquest of the Golden Fleece, at
Rebekah ordering Jacob to put on his hands and
neck kids’ skins, at all the examples of the Bible and
of history, we will only remark that the four noble
furs consecrated by feudality were the ermine, the
vair, the sable, and the miniver. The colours of
furs admitted into coats of arms were those of the
sable, the ermine, and the vair.</p>

<p>Charlemagne, who loved, they say, simplicity in
his apparel, had, according to Eginhard, the habit of
wearing in summer a mantle of otter’s skin; but in
winter he covered himself with a mantle of which the
sleeves were lined with vair and foxes’ fur. This is
corroborated by the four following verses of Philippe
Mousnes, the poet biographer of this Emperor:—</p>

<div class="poembox">
<p class="pi0">But in the days of fallen leaves,</p>
<p class="pi0">He wore a new surcoat with sleeves</p>
<p class="pi0">Of furs of foxes and of vair</p>
<p class="pi0">To shield him from the nipping air.</p>
</div>

<p>At the epoch of the Crusades, the luxury of furs
was carried to the highest degree in Western Europe;
but to remain absolutely fixed to the Muff, we must
register the first apparition of this little fur about
the end of the sixteenth century. In the inventory
of goods left by the widow of the President Nicolai
we read: Item,
a Muff of velvet
lined with marten.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_120.jpg" width="600" height="600" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In Venice, however, we have
in our researches found a vestige of
the Muff at the end of the fifteenth
century; celebrated courtezans and noble
ladies at that time carried Muffs, which served for niches
to minuscular dogs; and an engraving represents a scene of
an interior, in which a fair Venetian seems to be showing
her lover the infinite games of her lap-dogs in her Muff.</p>

<p>There were at that time in Venice delicious Muffs made
after the primitive fashion of a single band of velvet, brocade,
or silk, lined with fine fur, rounded in a cylinder, of
which the extremities were closed in different widths by
buttons of orient crystal, pearls or gold.</p>

<p>D’Aubigné, in his <em class="e000I2">Universal History</em>,
says in the course of a story of a besieged town:—“The inhabitants
descended thirty paces from the breach, and among the foremost was
noticed a woman <em class="e000I2">with Muffs</em>, a halberd in her
hand, who mixed with and distinguished herself in this combat.” Under
the designation of <em class="e000I2">Muffs</em> we must understand
here spare half-sleeves like those mentioned in the Library of
Vauprivas <em class="e000I2">à propos</em> of Louise Labé. Under
Charles IX. the simple citizen folk were only allowed to wear black
Muffs; ladies of the highest condition had alone a right to sumptuous
Muffs of various colours.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_121.jpg" width="600" height="272" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In a satiric print of 1634, signed Jaspar Isac, and entitled
<em class="e000I2">The Squire à la Mode</em>, we see carried by a woman, who is
accompanied on foot by a Gascon cavalier, the first French
Muff having a direct relation with that which is still in use
at the present day. It is a sheath of stuff or silk bordered
on both sides by a thick white fur, which grows into an
enormous roll at the ends.</p>

<p>But it is amongst the precious engravings of Hollar,
Abraham Bosse, Arnoult, Sandrart, Bonnard, and Trouvain
that we see the authentic Muff really born, and find it in
the hands of the Parisian matron, of the lady of quality
in her winter dress, of the <em class="e000I2">Précieuse</em>, and the coquetting
flirt. An engraving of Bonnard shows us a great lady
with her head dressed à la Fontange, and in court dress, on
the point of going out; a waiting-maid adjusts her mantle,
and a gentleman attends the beauty’s good pleasure; the
Muff she carries was then of a moderate size, with a bow in
the middle. The Muff was worn for style, “for grace,”
and was made of sable-marten for ladies of the Court, and
simply of dogskin or catskin for the small citizens’ wives
who could not devote more than fifteen to twenty francs
to the acquisition of this light hand-warmer.</p>

<p>Antoine Furetière, in his <em class="e000I2">Dictionary</em>, has condensed in a
few lines all the materials of a Dissertation on the Muff
of the seventeenth century. At the word <em class="e000I2">Muff</em> we
read:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A fur worn in winter, in which to put the hands, to keep
them warm. <em class="e000I2">Muffs</em> were formerly only for women: at the
present day they are carried by men. The finest <em class="e000I2">Muffs</em> are
made of marten, . . . . the common of miniver; . . . .
the country <em class="e000I2">Muffs</em> of the cavaliers are made of otter and of
tiger. A woman puts her nose in her <em class="e000I2">Muff</em> to hide herself.
A little <em class="e000I2">Muff</em>-dog is a little dog which ladies can carry in
their <em class="e000I2">Muff</em>.</p></div>

<p>Everything we see is summed up in this. Saint-Jean
and Bonnard have preserved for us types of
French gentlemen bearing the Muff under Louis
XIV. One, in court dress, carries with much
grace a small spotted Muff, which he holds in one
hand, showing a glimpse at the unoccupied end of
the cuff of a fur glove; another, in winter court-dress,
holds with the languor of a <em class="e000I2">petit-maître</em> a
pretty plump otter Muff falling to the hips, giving
a gracious curve to the arm; in the middle of this
Muff a vast bow of ribbons or <em class="e000I2">Galants</em>, something
like the old trimming called <em class="e000I2">petite oie</em>, is displayed
with an excellent effect. In 1680, nothing, according
to the <em class="e000I2">Mercure Galant</em>, was to be seen
but ribbons purfled with gold, laced, fringed,
wreathed, purled, or embroidered, which were
gathered in a bow in front, of the Muff.</p>

<p>La Fontaine alludes doubtless to the country
Muff spoken of by Furetière when, in the fable of
the <em class="e000I2">Monkey and the Leopard</em>, he makes the latter
say:—</p>

<div class="poembox">
<p class="pi0">The king desires me at his Court,</p>
<p class="pi0">And must have—if I die for’t—</p>
<p class="pi0">A <em class="e000I2">Muff</em>, made of my skin, so full of blots</p>
<p class="pi0">Of colour, and of lines, and dots,</p>
<p class="pi0">And dappled stains, and chequered spots.</p>
</div>

<p>As to the Muff-dog—to finish the registration of the definition
of Furetière—not only has Hollar left us an engraving of it, and
presented it to us under the form of a small Spaniel, but Father du
Cerceau makes his <em class="e000I2">upholsterer poet</em> say—Even the lady’s lapdog
barked at me, that ingrate</p>

<div class="poembox">
<p class="pi0">Cadet, for whom I used to stuff</p>
<p class="pi0">So many sweets inside my Muff.</p>
</div>

<p>The chief hall of the peltry merchants and furriers
of the 17th century, in Paris, was in the Rue
de la Tabletterie or Rue des Fourreurs, which
led into the cross-way of the Place aux Chats.
The shops of the retail peltry merchants were
nearly all situated in the City, Rue Saint-Jacques
de la Boucherie, and Rue de la Juiverie.</p>

<p>“In these places,” says Léger, “are to be found
very beautiful Muffs for men and for women, and
very fashionable ones . . . there are to be sold
also very beautiful amices of miniver.” He adds
a word about the Palatines properly got up, composed
of skins of animals, foreign and native.
The <em class="e000I2">Livre commode des adresses de Paris</em> contains some
designations of peltry merchants and furriers towards the
end of the seventeenth century.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_124.jpg" width="600" height="293" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Fashion altered the shape of the Muff considerably
under Louis XIV. From the rare documents which we
have been able to catalogue, we have easily found numerous
modifications in both form and volume. Sometimes narrow
and long, sometimes broad and short, it would be impossible
to assign to this little chattel an exact type for all that
epoch.</p>

<p>The Muff triumphed already, under Louis XIII., in the
empire of oglings and at the Place Royale, as it reigned
later at Versailles, and showed itself in sedan chairs in the
midst of the alleys of the park at the visiting hour, lending
always to woman a charming countenance and exquisite
graces.</p>

<p>Scarron, in his <em class="e000I2">Poésies Diverses</em>, has left us in four verses
a pretty picture of manners for any one who could morally
develop it. The poor cripple Scarron certainly had no
need of a Muff in his arm-chair!—</p>

<div class="poembox">
<p class="pi0">My wife then leaves at once, though she</p>
<p class="pi0">All perils should divide with me;</p>
<p class="pi2">She takes her Muff and goes</p>
<p class="pi2">To see some one she knows. . . .</p>
</div>

<p>But let us leave the age of big wigs and Fontange head-dresses,
and penetrate into the age of powder and patches,
into the age of Voltaire, who, <em class="e000I2">à propos</em> of one of his
characters in <em class="e000I2">Micromégas</em>, wrote:</p>

<p>“Imagine a very small Muff-dog following a captain of
the Guards of the King of Prussia.”</p>

<p>An engraving of the <em class="e000I2">Encyclopédie</em> presents us in the nick
of time with a faithful reproduction of a shop of a furrier of
the last century. Day penetrates through a large glass bow
window; all round, on shelves, are ranged Muffs and different
furs; two pleasing shopwomen offer their customers
enormous Muffs of miniver, and a shop-boy beats with a
rod one of those furred mantles which were sent “to be
kept” during the summer, to preserve them from the mites.
This engraving, a precious document which may be attributed
to Cochin, recalls two charming little stories of Restif
de la Bretonne in his <em class="e000I2">Contemporaines du Commun</em>: one
entitled <em class="e000I2">La Jolie Fourreuse</em>, the other <em class="e000I2">La Jolie Pelletière</em>.
Professions passed out of sight!</p>

<p>“Furs”—MM. de Goncourt wrote in a note of much study to their book
<em class="e000I2">La Femme au XVIII<sup>e</sup> Siècle</em>—“were
a great luxury of Parisian ladies, at the time when the fashion was
to arrive at the opera wrapt in the most superb and rarest, and to
take them off little by little with coquettish art.” The reputation
of the sable, the ermine, the miniver, the lynx, the otter, is
indicated in the <em class="e000I2">Étrennes Fourrées dédiées aux
jolies Frileuses</em>, Geneva, 1770. Muffs have quite a history,
from those on which the furrier brought discredit, in causing one to
be worn by the hangman on the execution day—these were probably Muffs
<em class="e000I2">à la Jésuite</em>, muffs which were not of fur,
and against which a pleasantry at the commencement of the century,
<em class="e000I2">A petition presented to the Pope by the master
furriers</em>, solicits excommunication—up to those of Angora goats’
hair, immense Muffs which reached to the ground, and to the little
Muffs at the end of the century, baptized <em class="e000I2">little
barrels</em>, as the Palatine was called <em class="e000I2">cat</em>.
The fashion of sledges, then very widely spread, added to the fashion
of furs. An etching of Caylus, after a drawing of Coypel, about the
middle of the century, shows us in a sledge set on dolphins—one of
those sledges which cost ten thousand crowns—a pretty woman dressed
entirely in fur, her head-dress a small bonnet of fur with an egret,
carried along in a sledge, which is driven by a coachman dressed
like a Muscovite, and standing at the back. <em class="e000I2">À
propos</em> of furs, the <em class="e000I2">Palatine</em> owes its
fortune and its name to the Duchess of Orléans, mother of the Regent,
known under the name of the Princess Palatine.</p>

<p>Palatines—which were made of fox, of marten,
of miniver—were worn for a long time with
<em class="e000I2">Polonaises</em> and <em class="e000I2">Hongrelines</em>. Roy, a French poet
of the 18th century, who made acquaintance with
the stick at different intervals—sent some bad
verses to a lady on the subject of her <em class="e000I2">blue palatine</em>.
The <em class="e000I2">Almanach des Muses</em> of 1772 has preserved
them for us. Here they are:—</p>

<div class="poembox">
<p class="pi4">That charming colour wear,</p>
<p class="pi0">The colour of the summer sky above,</p>
<p class="pi0">The colour Venus sets on every Love,</p>
<p class="pi1">Which makes the fairest faces yet more fair,</p>
<p class="pi0">As Venus in her own sweet self can prove:</p>
<p class="pi0">But the white place where falls the tufted bow</p>
<p class="pi1">Is nought indeed but lovely nakedness;</p>
<p class="pi1">Why hide it then? The beauty which men bless</p>
<p class="pi0">Gains on the whole by losing, don’t you know?</p>
</div>

<p>Caraccioli remarks that people used Muffs in
winter just as much for elegance as for need.
“The form varies continually,” he says; “to-day
(1768) men carry small Muffs lined with down,
and trimmed with black or grey satin.”</p>

<p>In 1720, women’s Muffs were very narrow and long; the crossed
hands filled it exactly; afterwards they became wider, like those
we may see on the hands of the pretty skaters of Lancret. A typical
Muff of the epoch was the ermine Muff, fearfully large, which we
find carried by the Venetian masks of the delicious Pietro Longhi,
who seems to have wished to illustrate by his pictures the <em
class="e000I2">Memoires</em> of Jacques Casanova of Seingalt. In
the small engravings of the century relating to travelling, which
show us the stoppages at the inn, or the packings in the public
vehicles, we see everywhere the feminine Muff delicately pressed
against their waists by the pretty adventuresses. Boucher’s skater,
who passes like a gracious Parisian little figure over a background
of a Dutch landscape, doubled up but valiant, appears to make a
prow of her Muff, the better to cleave the sharp cold air. But in
the intimacy of private life, in the eighteenth century as now, the
Muff could lend a charm to genre paintings, and the manufacturers of
prints might have composed many <em class="e000I2">Little posts</em>
and <em class="e000I2">Nests for love-letters</em>, interpreting by
their drawing what the author of the <em class="e000I2">Dictionnaire
des Amoureux</em> wished to express, when at the word <em
class="e000I2">Muff</em> he gives this piquant definition: <em
class="e000I2">A Letter-box, lined with white satin.</em></p>

<p>The most celebrated and the most delicious picture in which a Muff
figures is assuredly that adorable painting known by the name of <em
class="e000I2">The Young Girl with the Muff</em>, by Joshua Reynolds,
which formed part of the beautiful collection of the Marquis of
Hertford. Nothing is more delicate than this painting. That young
English-woman seems rather to walk through the picture than remain
fixed in it, so great, one might say, was the quickness with which
the painter has caught that image in its passage with its movement
of walking—the body is inclined a little forward, the head on one
side; the woman’s bust, which stops at the Muff, is so fresh in its
composition, so fine in its tonality, so radiant in its originality
of design, that it would be enough almost by itself to establish the
immortal reputation of Reynolds, who has put into his work a very
quintessence of femininity, as an ideal of the most exquisite English
loveliness, and also as a type, delicate and never to be forgotten,
of a chilly beauty.</p>

<p>Nor must we forget the <em class="e000I2">Portrait of Mrs.
Siddons</em>, painted by Gainsborough, in the charm of her
twenty-ninth year, in 1784. This picture, which was exhibited at
Manchester in 1857, is now in the <em class="e000I2">National
Gallery</em>. The charming lady, dressed in a fresh striped blue
and white robe, with a fawn-coloured shawl half falling from her
shoulders, has on her head a large black felt hat, ornamented with
feathers—one of those hats which have done more for the vulgarisation
of the glory of Gainsborough than all his studies and portraits.
Mrs. Siddons is seated, holding on her lap with her left hand a
comfortable Muff of fox or Siberian wolf, of which she appears to
caress the fur with her right hand, as if to show off the beauty and
whiteness of her spindle-shaped fingers. The mistress of the works
of a master who had, it is only right to say, the most ravishing
face in the world to portray. But, without needing to have further
recourse to the English school, have we not that luminous portrait
of Madame Vigée Lebrun, in which the Muff, raised almost level with
the head, spreads the shine of its hair of tawny gold like the head
of a courtezan of Venice? That astonishing painting of the end of the
eighteenth century appeared in its dazzling splendour, in the midst
of the square saloon of the Museum of the Louvre, killing, by mere
force of freshness and light, the magistral bituminous pictures of
the beginning of the century, which are its near neighbours.</p>

<p>Under Louis XVI. the frenzy of the toilette
reached its most acute crisis: fashions succeeded
one another in a few years with so much rapidity
that we can scarcely follow them; people sought
to outstrip in everything rather than to refine, and
the Muffs, carried by men and women alike, became
enormous and exaggerated. Hurtaut, in his
<em class="e000I2">Dictionnaire de la Ville de Paris</em>, article <em class="e000I2">Modes</em>,
makes this strange remark in the year 1784, “A
lady has been seen at the opera with a <em class="e000I2">Muff of
momentaneous agitation</em>.”</p>

<p>The intellect loses itself in seeking the exact
definition of this qualificative of <em class="e000I2">momentaneous
agitation</em>!</p>

<p>In 1788 a fashion was Muffs of Siberian wolf.
According to the <em class="e000I2">Magasin des Modes Nouvelles
Françaises et Anglaises</em>, the young folks no longer
carried their Muff after the peaceable and good
citizen-like fashion <em class="e000I2">à la papa</em> level with the bottom
of the waistcoat; they used it, on the contrary,
like a plaything or an opera hat; they held it
in their hand while gesticulating in their promenades,
or carried it under their arms like a portfolio
strangled and crumpled between the elbow
and the chest.</p>

<p>The little dogs, the Muff-toy-terriers, which had
continued in favour since the Regency, were more
in request now than ever; every woman of fashion
had her pug and her King Charles’ pet, like those
small dogs that now come from Havanna.</p>

<p>In the celebrated coloured engraving of Debucourt,
<em class="e000I2">La Galerie de Bois au Palais-Royal</em>, in 1787, we see
circulating in the midst of that strange crowd which was
called the medley of the Palais-Royal, extravagant types,
among them women holding in their hand beside their
furred cloak those incredible Muffs of an immense
size, which figure also under the arms of the masked
gallants of the time, with a small bow of satin attached
to the fur.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 570px;">
<img src="images/i_132.jpg" width="570" height="700" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Under the Revolution and the Directory the fashion of Muffs was
extremes, either broad as little barrels, or narrow and minuscular;
in other respects the fashion varied infinitely, and we must come to
the Restoration to find the first chinchilla Muffs which harmonised
with the velvet witchouras. Absurd fashions to study! What Muff
would the painter choose who wished, by way of allegory, to show
a grasshopper shivering in the hoar frost and the snow, to whom
charitable Love brings a downy Muff? A pretty subject for a concourse
of an Academy which claimed to be <em class="e000I2">précieuse</em>
and refined.</p>

<p>In 1835, Muffs, boas, palatines, cloaks lined with marten or fox,
affected odious and indescribable forms: they used to make for a time
Glove-Muffs, a sort of mittens of marten, which were soldered on to
one another where the hands crossed. The Muff, that accessory of the
toilet, ought to be in harmony with the general tonality and style of
costume. Therefore, to undertake to describe it at that epoch would
be only possible in sketching a complete history of Fashion.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_133.jpg" width="600" height="483" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The picturesque Muff of 1830 to 1850, is assuredly the big
Muff of the Parisian or provincial tradeswomen, those Muffs,
larders and lumber-rooms, which we meet in the deobstruent
tales of Paul de Kock, and see figuring in the primitive
tilted spring-carts driven by the master, in which are packed
the mistress and all the assistant clerks, with a view to exploring
some suburban corner on Sunday, there to laugh
with their muffs pressed before their mouths, and to act a
thousand follies of a doubtful taste, and to banquet plentifully,
and to sing during the dessert some free-and-easy ditty,
very jovial, after the fashion of those pleasant couplets of
Laujon on <em class="e000I2">The Muff</em>, which I will quote here,
with the more confidence, since they figure in
the <em class="e000I2">Chansons de Parades</em> collected by that boon
companion, who was at the same time member of
the Caveau and of the Institute:—</p>

<p>What laughter, what shouts, what chokings, in those parties <em
class="e000I2">à la</em> Paul de Kock, when an artless maiden—at the
time when pleasant digestion had set its bloom on all faces—sang, one
by one, these ancient couplets, with an air at once of a whimpering
girl and of a woman full of coquettish intelligence.</p>

<p>The Muff has not always brought tears of laughter to the eyes,
and a physiologist might draw from it many a curious deduction;
only to cite a single instance, in the middle of the <em
class="e000I2">Scènes de la Vie de Bohème</em>, in the episode of
Francine’s Muff, which should remain in every reader’s memory—the
tears come into all our eyes resultant from an emotion at once
sincere and profound.</p>

<p>Francine has been condemned by her doctor,
and <em class="e000I2">hears with her eyes</em> the terrible sentence of the
physician.</p>

<p>“Don’t listen to him,” says she to her love,
“don’t listen to him, Jacques, he is telling stories;
we will go out to-morrow, it is All Hallows Day,
it will be cold, . . . go and buy me a Muff, . . . mind
it is a good one, . . . and will last a long while; I am
afraid of having chilblains this winter.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_136.jpg" width="600" height="431" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Then, when Jacques has brought the Muff: “It is very
pretty,” said Francine; “I will carry it in our walk.”</p>

<p>The morrow, All Hallows Day, about the time of the
Angelus of noon, she was seized with the death-struggle,
and all her body began to tremble. “My hands are
cold, cold,” she murmured, “give me my Muff, dear”—and
she plunged her poor little fingers into the fur.</p>

<p>“It is over,” said the doctor to Jacques, “give her a
last kiss;” and Jacques glued his lips to those of his
darling. At the last moment, they wished to take away
her Muff, but her hands still clung to it.</p>

<p>“No, no,” she cried, “let it be—we are in winter, it is
cold. Ah my poor Jacques!”</p>

<p>And so Francine dies, without quitting her Muff. A
poignant and lugubrious story, like the work of Murger
in general; the <em class="e000I2">Muff of Francine</em> will perhaps be the
most durable chapter in the <em class="e000I2">Vie de Bohème</em>. We have
not been able to set this realistic scene upon the stage,
but a painter, M. Haquette, has displayed it after an
admirable manner in one of his best pictures exhibited
in one of the Paris annual Salons.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 422px;">
<img src="images/i_137e.jpg" width="422" height="360" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Truly the Muff calls up many sad
thoughts for sentimental and charitable
souls; this winter chattel reminds them of the sorrows
of those who are without fire and home and comfortable
clothing, and when the north wind blows without, and the
snow falls softly in sombre silence, more than one dreaming
girl, with her elbow leaning on the window-sill, lets her
Muff fall while thinking of those unfortunates who suffer, of
the careless grasshoppers and the laborious ants, of whom
an adverse fortune has deceived the foresight.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 144px;">
<img src="images/i_137e-2.jpg" width="144" height="195" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The Muff, the mysterious Muff, hides many distresses:
we see it at the present day on the hands of all the working
girls and milliners, who set out early in the winter mornings
from their homes for the distant workshops; and it is a load
upon one’s heart to see all these miserable little Muffs
made of rabbit or black cat, out of which peeps
often the golden point of a penny roll and a greasy
paper which envelops a chlorotic piece of pork
or an <em class="e000I2">Arlequin</em> (bits of broken meat) bought in
the early market. The Muff which warms so
many pretty hands brave and toiling, seems in
winter to be the refuge of virtue, shivering but victorious.</p>

<p>How much luxury is there, on the other hand, in
the Muffs of the fine world during the last twenty years!
They have been made very small, of sable tails,
and very expensive; but there have been also
some more modest, made with that marten of Australia
which took the place of the Astrakhan,
which passed out of fashion in 1860. They have
been manufactured also in velvet plush or in cloth,
with borders of fur or feathers, and a large bow of
ribbons in the centre. Some became veritable
scent-bags, perfumed with heliotrope, rose, gardenia,
verbena, violet, or they were powdered
inside with orris root or <em class="e000I2">poudre à la Maréchale</em>.</p>

<p>An elegant and witty lady-correspondent of
fashion, who signs with the word <em class="e000I2">Étincelle</em> the
notes full of charming confusion in her <em class="e000I2">Carnet
d’un Mondain</em>, lately gave the nomenclature of the
Muffs of the day, painted in water-colours:</p>

<p>“The Nest-Muff, in satin <em class="e000I2">coulissé</em>, lined with
black and white lace, with a whole company of
little Indian birds and frightened paroquets hiding
themselves in the satin folds.”</p>

<p>“The Flower-Muff, very small, of ivory plush,
rouge cardinal or marine blue, with bunches of
roses, marigolds, camellias, and violets blossoming
in the midst of a great deal of lace.”</p>

<p>“The Watteau-Muff for the evening: a round
of Loves painted on white satin. The Coppée-Muff:
sparrows sunk in a sky of black satin. The
Figaro-Muff, in black velvet, entirely covered with
a net of black and gold chenille: three humming-birds
in a nest of black lace. The Duchess Muff:
all of Marabout, imitating fur, shaded with little
bows of dead satin. The Castilian, in plush,
covered with point noir: an orange parroquet in
the middle standing out in relief on a fan of
black lace. The Minerva, in skunk or sable, with
a black satin bow and the head of a barn-door
owl.”</p>

<p>All these fashions of to-day are already fashions
of yesterday, so perpetual is the inconstancy of <em class="e000I2">la
Mode</em>! To-day the monkey, blue fox, beaver,
swan, and ermine are metamorphosed into Muffs;
to-morrow will come the furs of sable, of otter, of
chinchilla, of squirrel, of marten, of wolf, &#38;c.
Women and furs change, and will change, soon
and often.</p>

<p>Fashion is the everlasting Fairy; whether she
take the Sunshade as a rod at the end of her
gloved hand, or the Muff as a surprise-box or a
cornucopia, she is never short of inventions, of
prodigies, of follies, and of ruins; she seems to
avenge herself on the moderns because the ancients
gave her not divine honours, nor placed her upon
the summit of their Olympus. Let, then, the
head of this new and great goddess be adorned
with a weathercock helmet, of which Love will
furnish the magnetic arrow, and let a statue be
raised to that great first French citizeness, who from Paris
governs the world with so formidable a despotism, against
whom none ever dreams of raising a revolt.</p>

<p>For us, who, <em class="e000I2">à propos</em> of the Sunshade, the Glove, and
the Muff, have just cast a glance upon the museum of
this female ruler, we are in a state of dread from the inconceivable
variety of objects which were for an hour a
woman’s pleasure, and, if we have not conducted our
readers before all the glass cases of this national museum,
great as the universe, or “the vastest in the world,” as all
large milliners’ shops entitle themselves, it is because around
the ornaments of women the fickle Loves will always dance
their frenzied round, which only a madman can ever hope
and wish to stop. It has been said that Fashion is woman’s
only literature; if, however, our elegant ladies were condemned
to study the special archæology of this literature,
very soon—as in love—would they desert History for
Romance.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_143.jpg"
 width="42" height="42" alt="" />
WE see sometimes appearing certain light
little works connected either with literary
history or ancient poetry, or manners
and customs, which would be nothing but
pretty and curious pamphlets, if the Appendix
which follows them were not swelled out of all
proportion with proofs and illustrations, annotated
notes, documents with sidenotes, bibliographic
bibliography, considerations and commentaries
of all sorts, which put the reader
to the torture. By this proceeding of an exaggerated
literary conscience, an opuscule of thirty
pages arrives sometimes at three hundred: it is
in some sense a case of erudite exaltation, sometimes
also a vain-glory of the investigator, who
has a mind to climb up the pyramid of books
he has examined, proudly there to set up his
silhouette, as we plant a flag on a building as
soon as it is complete.</p>

<p>As an epilogue to another volume of this series,
<em class="e000I2">The Fan</em>, we published a sketch of documentary
bibliography to indicate the principal works which
we had searched for the little materials necessary
for that monograph. You will find there
six or eight pages of titles placed without order,
and ending with this phrase of a man out of
breath, and expressing extreme fatigue—<em class="e000I2">et cœtera</em>.</p>

<p>And in this <em class="e000I2">et cœtera</em> we have set now a hundred
library shelves in the shadow—sparing thus our
most fastidious readers an extremely bitter pill,
and sparing ourselves also the fatigues of an
interminable catalogue of no great profit to any
one, considering the nature of the work in question,
and the fashion in which we have treated it.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the three unpretending
pieces of chit-chat which we have just engaged in
about <em class="e000I2">The Sunshade, the Glove, and the Muff</em>, people
may expect to see figuring here the lineaments or
first matters of the canvas on which we embroidered
our bold arabesques. People will be deceived.
It will please us for this time to hide the innumerable
instruments of our thefts; they are still
there by our sides, making walls and barricades
upon our tables and the seats round about us.
But if, on the termination of a task, we love
usually to put back regularly in order a library
turned upside down by the fever of researches,
happy in being nourished by the intellectual juice
of old books, sometimes also we are prostrated by
that intense discouragement which “dumfounds
a man,” according to an every-day expression.
In fact, the result has not answered so great a
working up of material, a picture has been dreamed
of too big for the frame, the artist has been obliged
to reduce himself, to resign himself, and to put in
nothing of his own essence; in short, the Mosaic
<em class="e000I2">littérateur</em> looks at the Little Thing he has just
finished beside the Great Matter which he had
conceived.</p>

<p>In like conditions, the <em class="e000I2">meâ culpâ</em> is the sole
preventive parade that can be made in his retreat
to questions which become twisted into a note of
interrogation on the smiling lips of the reader.</p>

<p>To make an inventory of the books we have
consulted would be a torture worse than that of
Tantalus, for desire, far from looking forward with
eagerness, would look sadly back, like an old
man who sees again in memory the women of
his twentieth year, whom he has let fly under
the willows without profiting in their pursuit by
the vigour of his legs.</p>

<p>These books—which we serve not up here—are
full of documents which we have not been
able to enshrine, and it seems that the crumbs
which fall from the table make a larger volume
than the repast which has just been taken.</p>

<p>For the rest, a truce to sadness and superfluous
regrets! Who knows whether we are not odiously
unjust to ourselves? Who knows whether the
little schoolboy path which we have chosen is
not the prettiest, the least rugged, the most unforeseen—that
is to say, the least painful and the
most verdant, and at the same time the shortest?</p>

<p>Every work, however small it may be, requires
distance, a time of calm and oblivion. The eye
of the painter wanders in distress before one and
the same picture for entire days; the brain of an
investigator becomes anchylosed and petrified by
dreaming in one and the same atmosphere of
small ideas which remain attached to dress.</p>

<p>When we shall have unfurnished our skull of
those delicate things, <em class="e000I2">the Sunshade, Glove, and
Muff</em>, to carry thither a current of more serious
conceptions, we shall perhaps have leisure to
read again our little work as strangers, and not
as producers, and thus, doubtless, we shall reflect
with a satisfied smile, that there was much more
in us of wisdom than carelessness in not tarrying
too long amongst such charming trifles!</p>

<p>“These editions are noteworthy as containing original etchings by
artists of high repute. Thus nineteen exquisite plates by the French
etcher, M. Lalauze, gives especial attractiveness to the ‘Thousand
and One Nights;’ and the two fanciful histories of the Caliph Vathek
and Prince Rasselas are illustrated by designs of Mr. A. H. Tourrier,
etched by M. Damman. It is a pleasure to hold a ‘Robinson Crusoe’ or
the ‘Tale of a Tub’ in one’s hands; it is a positive luxury to read
those masterpieces in a luxurious shape, large print, on good paper,
accompanied by exquisite illustrations.”</p>

<p class="citation">The Scotsman.</p>

<p>“These volumes will take rank, for beauty of typography and
general excellence of appearance, with any books of the kind that
have recently been published; while the etchings by M. Lalauze are
among some of the finest of his productions. They are full of vigour
and striking originality, and are what they profess to be—good
illustrations of the story to which they relate. There are not many
men of wholesome minds who do not find enjoyment in ‘Robinson Crusoe’
whenever they can lay hands on it; and assuredly there is no one
possessing anything in the shape of a library who would not desire to
have a good edition of the work among his books; in short, nothing
but praise can be given to this edition of these books. No one can
pretend to be acquainted with English literature who is ignorant of
any of the works here published.”</p>

<p class="citation">Glasgow Herald.</p>

<p>“The merits of this new issue lie in exquisite clearness of type,
completeness; notes and biographical notices, short and pithy, and
a number of very fine etchings and portraits. The illustrations of
Gulliver are particularly effective, such as the ‘Academy of Laputa’
and the ‘Visions of Glubbdubdrib.’”</p>

<p class="citation">London Figaro.</p>

<p>“We congratulate the publishers upon the issue of a capital
series of Old English Romances. They will form a most delightful
collection.”</p>

<p class="citation">Magazine of Art.</p>

<p>“The text of the new four volume edition of the ‘Thousand and
One Nights’ is that revised by Jonathan Scott from the French of
Galland. It is, in fact, the text in which the incomparable ‘Arabian
Nights’ became in England the classic it is. The etchings are
uncommonly skilful and finished work; they contain some charming
figures; they constitute a true attraction. In another volume of this
series Beckford’s wild and gloomy ‘Vathek’ appears side by side with
Johnson’s admirable ‘Rasselas.’”</p>

<p class="citation">The Literary World.</p>

<p>“A publishers’ notice prefixed to each volume states that ‘one
thousand copies of this edition have been printed and the type
distributed. No more will be published.’ Although some of these works
are now easily obtainable in a cheap form, good editions are rare and
eagerly sought by those who make any pretence of making a library.
Here is an opportunity of securing as choice an edition as can be
desired at a comparatively low price, the value of which will be
enhanced before long by its scarcity.”</p>

<p class="citation">The Times.</p>

<p>“Prettily printed and prettily illustrated, these attractive
volumes deserve their welcome from all students of seventeenth
century literature.”</p>

<p class="citation">The Daily News.</p>

<p>“The merit for modern readers of these old stories lies partly
in their inexhaustible wit, their knowledge of human nature, which
never grows stale, and partly in their pictures of the old reckless
life of Spain. A typical example of these novels is the fictitious
autobiography of Guzman d’Alfarache, the Spanish rogue, written by
Matthew Aleman at the beginning of the seventeenth century.”</p>


<p class="citation">Daily Telegraph.</p>

<p>“A handy and beautiful edition, in twelve volumes, of the works
of the Spanish masters of romance calls for a word of acknowledgment
from all who desire to see the lights of foreign literature fitly
presented to the notice of English readers. We may say of this
edition of the immortal work of Cervantes, that it is most tastefully
and admirably executed, and that it is embellished with a series
of striking etchings from the pen of the Spanish artist, De Los
Rios. . . . Those who have already made acquaintance with these
masterpieces of exotic humour will need no encouragement to send
them once again to a fountain from which such pure enjoyment is to
be derived, and in so acceptable a shape as Messrs. Nimmo &#38; Bain
have provided.”</p>

<p class="citation">The Scotsman.</p>

<p>“What man of middle age is there, who has been a reader of books,
who does not look back with pleasure to his first acquaintance with
‘Don Quixote’ or the ‘Adventures of Gil Blas’? If he has been a wise
man of equal mind, he has gone further afield in these romances, and
has made acquaintance with ‘Asmodeus,’ ‘The Bachelor of Salamanca,’
and other works of a like kind. They have been read by many thousands
of British readers, and they will be read by many thousands
more. . . . What the reading public have reason to congratulate
themselves upon is, that so neat, compact, and well-arranged an
edition of romances that can never die is put within their reach. The
publishers have spared no pains with them. It has already been said
that Mr. Saintsbury has written a prefatorial notice of Le Sage; a
similar work has been done by other hands in the case of Cervantes.
It is satisfactory to find publishers turning their attention to the
reproduction, in worthy form, of classic fiction; and the hope may be
entertained that in this case the enterprise will meet with merited
reward.”</p>

<p>“We notice with warm welcome a new and very handsome illustrated
edition of the original ‘Arabian Nights Entertainment,’ the ‘real
Simon pure,’ and never have we seen the fascinating companion of our
youth more ‘daintily dight.’ Type and paper are both of the finest
quality, while M. Lalauze’s graceful and delicate etchings lend
an additional charm to the text. ‘The Thousand and One Nights of
Schéhérézade’ occupy four goodly volumes, and uniform with them is
Beckford’s ‘Vathek’ and Dr. Johnson’s ‘Rasselas’ in one volume.”</p>
